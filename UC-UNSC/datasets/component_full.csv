the situation regarding Ukraine has seriously deteriorated.,claim
"Following close to two weeks of relative calm, starting on 6 April armed individuals and separatist groups began to seize Government buildings and confiscate lethal weapons in Donetsk oblast of Ukraine, including in the cities of Donetsk, Lugansk and Kharkiv.",premise
The individuals involved called for secession from Ukraine and for joining the Russian Federation.,premise
"In Donetsk, some of these individuals declared a People's Republic of Donetsk.",premise
"It has now been reported that there have been at least five new cities in eastern Ukraine targeted by uprisings and seizures of Government buildings in the past 24 hours, including the towns of Sloviansk, Kramatorsk and Druzhkivka.",premise
United Nations monitors have reported a consistent reinforcement of barricades and armed civilians on both sides.,premise
"They also sighted armed militiamen with AK-47s, machine guns and sniper rifles.",premise
"United Nations monitors have also reported duelling rallies in Kharkiv today, resulting in injuries to some 50 persons.",premise
"On the eve of 13 April, authorities in Kyiv launched an ""anti-terror"" operation to reclaim Sloviansk, a day after it was overrun by pro-separatist activists, whom the United Nations human rights monitors on the ground have described as well-armed and well-organized militiamen.",premise
"As of 13 April, at least one Ukrainian officer has been killed in a gun battle; however, the exact number of casualties in the skirmishes remains unknown.",premise
Numerous others have been reported wounded.,premise
"Also today, Ukraine's acting President, Oleksandr Turchynov, signed a presidential decree, giving the self-declared separatists until 6 am.",premise
Kyiv time to give up their weapons in order to avoid prosecution.,premise
"The President further declared in a televised address to the nation that if illegal activities were not halted, a full-scale operation involving the Ukrainian army would be launched.",premise
"The Russian Federation has publicly stated on several occasions that it would be ""forced to act"" if Kyiv were to employ force against demonstrators in the East.",premise
The situation is therefore now more combustible than ever.,claim
The Secretary-General and the United Nations remain committed to the pursuit of a peaceful solution to this ever-deepening crisis.,claim
The Secretary-General has continued to speak out for the exercise of maximum restraint by all concerned and strict adherence to international law.,claim
He also continues to urge all others with influence on the situation to immediately and publicly call for restraint and a return to calm.,claim
"The Secretary-General further appeals for direct and constructive dialogue between the parties, and between Kyiv and Moscow, to de-escalate the situation and address all differences.",claim
It has become painfully evident that the Ukraine crisis will continue to deepen if intensive efforts are not urgently made by all concerned to de-escalate the situation.,claim
"At this moment, Ukraine teeters on the very brink.",claim
"However, it is not just Ukraine that will suffer from a scenario where the likelihood of further bloodshed and violent clashes grows by the hour.",claim
"Russia, which shares a long border area with Ukraine as well as the broader European region, faces a spillover effect of potentially severe consequences.",premise
Such scenarios will also have repercussions for the entire international community.,claim
the reckless actions that led to the coup d'etat by the self-proclaimed Kyiv authorities threaten to definitively destroy the fragile mosaic of Ukrainian society,claim
"The authorities do not wish to listen to those who do not accept the imposed dominance of Kyiv by national radicals and chauvinistic, Russophobic and anti-Semitic forces, whom they perceive as a threat to their human dignity and to their very lives.",premise
Grotesque Russophobia and entrenched hatred have become the norm in the Verkhovna Rada as well.,claim
"A few days ago, a member of Parliament belonging to the chauvinist Svoboda party said this about the Russian-speaking inhabitants of Ukraine: ""I would have acted much more harshly.",premise
I would simply have shot them.,premise
The enemy is prevailing in our land.,premise
They should have been chased out in 1654.,premise
"These creatures deserve only one thing - death.""",premise
It should be noted that this was said by a woman.,premise
We can only imagine the thoughts that must be churning in the minds of her brutal fellow partisans.,premise
Should we be surprised that the peaceful political protects and the call by the people of south-eastern Ukraine for their aspirations to be heard have been met by the Rada with draconic laws entailing long-term prison sentences for separatism?,claim
"The events of the past two days have shown that,",premise
"following our many calls for the organization of inclusive national political dialogue, a measure of common sense has prevailed in Kyiv.",claim
"Prime Minister Yatsenyuk went to Donetsk; although he did not meet with the protesters, he did say the right things about dialogue, decentralization and his desire to find a way out of the problem.",premise
"However, on 13 April the Verkhovna Rada-appointed President Turchynov stated that the Ukrainian Security Council had decided to launch a full-scale anti-terrorist operation, including the use of the armed forces.",premise
"However, unlike the Maidan demonstrators, the protesters have terrorized no one, have used no bulldozers against the authorioties, and thrown no Molotov cocktails.",premise
It is no coincidence that law-enforcement officers were present among the Maidan protestors.,premise
"According to Turchynov, the people of south-eastern Ukraine must end their protests by the morning of Monday, 14 April, lest armed force be used",premise
"However, the protesters' interests and opinions have not been taken into account or even discussed.",premise
"As a result, blood has already been shed in the South-East and the situation is extremely dangerous.",claim
Any further escalation of the situation must be swiftly stopped.,claim
The international community must require the Maidan henchmen who seized power in Kyiv to cease their war against their own people and to implement all the commitments under the 21 February agreement.,claim
"The Western sponsors of the Maidan henchmen, in particular those who stood as witnesses to the agreement and the United States, which is their backer, are obligated to end their support, dissociate themselves from neo-Nazis and other extremists, stop the use of force against the Ukrainian people, and begin forthwith a genuine national dialogue with the full participation of all regions, in the interests of the speedy implementation of radical constitutional reform.",claim
It is the West that must determine the opportunity for avoiding civil war in Ukraine.,claim
"Some people, including in this Chamber, do not wish to recognize the real reasons for the events in Ukraine and are forever seeing the hand of Moscow in the South-East.",premise
Enough is enough.,premise
"They must stop claiming that we have deployed our army along the border with that country and are practically already at the English Channel, and that we have sent agents to coordinate the protests in Ukraine.",claim
"It must be understood that south-eastern Ukraine and its people are deeply worried about their future and that they do not want anyone, especially the nationalist radicals, to impose their will on them.",claim
Lithuania is deeply concerned about the sharp deterioration of the situation in eastern Ukraine.,claim
"External forces and local provocateurs continue to fuel separatism and hatred, destabilizing the situation in eastern Ukraine on the eve of the 25 May elections.",premise
The scenario is dangerously familiar.,premise
"Where there was no unrest, unrest and chaos are being created by pro-Russian militias, again anonymous and without insignia, and again carrying modern models of assault weapons as seen in Crimea.",premise
"Again, considerable Russian troops are massed on Ukraine's borders.",premise
"Again, the external anti-Ukranian and anti-Western propaganda machine is in full swing, inciting suspicion, mistrust and hatred waiting to explode.",premise
"Ukraine's traitor Yanukovich, who abandoned his country and fled, opening the floodgates to Crimea's annexation, is being pushed again into the daylight to clear the way for Ukraine's further dismemberment",premise
"Groups of provocateurs in the hundreds, supported by pro-Russian militias, are attacking buildings of Ukraine's State institutions and declaring independence from Ukraine, as well as announcing plans for new referendums on joining Russia, in spite of the fact that recent opinion polls clearly show that the predominant majority of people in the region see their future inextricably linked to Ukraine.",premise
"about 65 per cent of the region's residents, according to opinion polls, have expressed their desire to remain part of Ukraine, while only 18.2 per cent want to join Russia.",premise
bloodshed is happening where there was no bloodshed before pro-Russian militants started their creeping secessionist provocations.,premise
"It is as clear as day that, in spite of the reassurances we heard from Moscow a few weeks ago, military aggression against Ukraine and its sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity has not stopped with Crimea.",claim
"My Government strongly condemns the actions of the separatist groups and their sponsors in the Donetsk region, as well as in the regions of Luhansk and Kharkiv.",claim
Lithuania supports the efforts of the Government of Ukraine to resolve this complex and unpredictable situation in a peaceful way.,claim
Ukraine's Government has reached out repeatedly to the separatists.,premise
"Ukraine's acting President Turchinov has decided to prepare a law on decentralization, granting more powers to the regions.",premise
Acting Prime Minister Yatseniuk has clearly stated that the Government must respond to people's desire to have more regional authority.,premise
"That decision is an important step forward, showing the flexibility and readiness of legitimate Ukrainian authorities to heed its population and engage constructively.",claim
Prime Minister Yatseniuk also reassured the Russian-speaking population regarding the use of the Russian language.,premise
"Furthermore, amnesty was offered to all militants who laid down arms and returned to seeking a peaceful solution to existing issues.",premise
"It is obvious that the Ukrainian Government is doing everything possible, under such dramatic circumstances, to respond to the legitimate needs and concerns of the population, to curb corruption and impunity,",claim
to re-establish law and order and the authority of the State and to address the problems the Government inherited from years of neglect and mismanagement.,claim
We fully support those efforts and once again stress the extraordinary restraint and patience with which Ukraine's Government has continued to respond to the unending provocations and efforts to dismember the State by armed pro-Russian militants and separatists.,claim
"when the existence of a State is put in danger,",premise
we understand and support the right of Ukraine to defend itself in the face of external aggression and to tackle militant separatism and continuous provocations in order to protect the State and its population from a further escalation of violence.,claim
The international community and members of the Council should not be fooled by the pronouncements of the likes of Yanukovich and his corrupt cronies.,premise
"The independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine are being threatened,",premise
"and that threat is a threat to the security and stability of the whole region and Europe, with serious international repercussions.",premise
"We urge the Russian Federation to call back its troops from the Ukrainian border, to stop supporting separatist groups and to cease all other actions aimed at destabilizing Ukraine.",claim
"The meeting among the United States, Russia, Ukraine and the European Union foreseen for 17 April in Geneva wold offer a viable chance for dialogue and diplomacy.",premise
We call on Russia not to waste that opportunity.,claim
The human stakes of what is happening in Ukraine are extremely high.,claim
"The lives of innocent civilians are at risk, yet we are being bombarded by Russian disinformation and propaganda",premise
the Ukrainians are being confronted by incitement and violence.,premise
"Russian media and Government spokespersons are spreading fiction, so we must tonight focus on facts.",claim
"The Council has heard, these last weeks, Russia disclaim any intention of occupying or invading.",premise
"The Council has heard it publicly, and we have heard it privately.",premise
"the fact is that the armed seizure of buildings in six eastern Ukrainian towns yesterday, and several more today,",premise
mirrors the tactics Russian forces used in the early stages of the Crimea invasion.,claim
"Then, too, officials from the Russian Federation spoke early on in the crisis and disclaimed any intention of occupying or invading.",premise
"In the earlier Crimean case, highly organized, well-equipped and professional forces wearing Russian military uniforms and military gear without identifying insignia moved in first to take control of Crimean Government and security facilities, before being later replaced by regular Russian military forces.",premise
"Then, too, Russia said it was acting to protect minorities' rights.",premise
But the whole world now knows that they were not.,claim
"As the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe has reported, the minorities at risk in Crimea are Tatars and Ukrainians.",premise
"The Council has heard that there are no Russian troops in eastern Ukraine, but the fact is that many of the armed units that we have seen were outfitted in bullet-proof vests and camouflage uniforms with insignia removed.",premise
"Those armed units, some wearing black and orange Saint George's ribbons - associated with Russian Victory Day celebrations - raised Russian and separatist flags over seized buildings and have called for referendums and union with Russia.",premise
"indeed, the only entity in the area capable of those coordinated, professional military actions is Russia.",claim
"The synchronized surgical seizure of buildings yesterday occurred in towns along the main highway, followed by armed roadblocks, almost as ifa coordinated barrier were being formed between Kyiv and the major eastern cities of Donetsk and Luhansk.",premise
"it need only witness for itself the videos of professional military shepherding thugs into a building in Kramatorsk; the photographs showing the so-called concerned citizens taking over Sloviansk, equipped exactly like the elite troops that took Crimea; or the video of a military operation in Krasny Liman by armed men with the same equipment.",premise
"The Council has heard laments about instability, as ifinstability were organic.",premise
But the fact is that this is the saddest kind of instability: it is completely man-made.,claim
This instability was written and choreographed in and by Russia.,claim
"We continue efforts to de-escalate the situation in Ukraine and find a diplomatic path forward, which is why Secretary Kerry will participate in the Geneva talks on 17 April, which will include Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov.",claim
"Russia will have to explain why its forces continue to mass on the Ukrainian border - at least 40,000 forces",claim
it will have to come with constructive ideas on how to de-escalate and resolve the armed attacks on buildings in eastern Ukraine.,claim
The United States stands with Ukraine and the fundamental principle that the future of Ukraine must be decided by the Ukrainian people.,claim
We also stand with international law and norms and the fundamental principle that borders are not suggestions.,claim
"On Monday, we will conclude the $1 billion loan guarantee for Ukraine.",premise
"That will benefit all the Ukrainian people, including minorities",premise
"Next week, Vice-President Biden will visit Ukraine.",premise
We strongly support concluding the agreement between Ukraine and the International Monetary Fund so that the international community can bolster Ukraine's economy.,claim
And we will support in every way we can Ukraine's elections at the end of May so that Ukraine can advance its political transition and look to a peaceful future.,claim
"The United Kingdom is gravely concerned by events in eastern Ukraine, which have escalated over the past 48 hours",claim
with armed men seizing control of Government buildings and erecting checkpoints and barricades in six different cities.,premise
Street protests have given way to violent action.,premise
That is a dangerous escalation of an already dangerous situation.,claim
"We have all seen the video footage of events over the weekend: professional, well-armed and well-equipped units wearing identical uniforms conducting coordinated military operations against Ukrainian State institutions.",premise
That is a pattern that is all too familiar.,premise
Coming just weeks after Russian troops illegally deployed to Crimea while wearing uniforms without insignia,premise
Russia once again interfering directly in the internal affairs of Ukraine while using manufactured pretexts and military force.,claim
"Such actions are contrary to international law, have already been condemned by the international community and have been declared invalid by the General Assembly.",claim
"As a Member of the United Nations, and as a permanent member of the Security Council,",premise
Russia is obliged to refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity and political independence of any State.,claim
"Yet satellite images show that there are between 35,000 and 40,000 Russian troops in the vicinity of the border with Ukraine, equipped with combat aircraft, tanks, artillery and logistical support units.",premise
"That is in addition to the 25,000 Russian troops based illegally in Crimea.",premise
"Just as six weeks ago Russia denied deploying its troops to Crimea, it also now denies that it has amassed troops on Ukraine's eastern border.",premise
the publicly available satellite images illustrating that troop deployment were taken in August 2013.,premise
That is false;,claim
additional images released on 11 April show clearly that the build-up started in early March of this year.,premise
"Russia's aggressive stance is a clear threat to the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine.",claim
"The United Kingdom calls on Russia immediately to redeploy its troops away from the border, cease all activity designed to heighten tensions and sow discord, and revoke the mandate given by the Federation Council on 1 March to use military force on Ukrainian soil.",claim
The Russian Federation has made little secret of its efforts to undermine the process of reconciliation in Ukraine.,premise
"Rather than assisting its neighbours in rebuilding their country after the fall of a deeply corrupt regime that left the nation on the verge of bankruptcy, Russia has instead sought to destabilize the country further in pursuit of its narrow interests.",premise
"Russia must desist from those steps and address whatever grievances it has through dialogue, starting with the contact group talks scheduled for this coming week.",claim
The international community is not fooled by the Kremlin's use of propaganda and misinformation to spread fears among the population of eastern Ukraine.,claim
the recent demonstrations in eastern cities are not organic.,claim
"They do not enjoy widespread support, and the numbers of genuine protestors on the streets pale in comparison to the crowds of hundreds of thousands who protested against the former regime.",premise
what we are witnessing is a well-orchestrated campaign designed to destabilize the country.,claim
"If Russia really has genuine concerns about Ukraine's Russian-speaking population, then its actions have done nothing to safeguard their interests.",premise
"The illegal annexation of Crimea, stoking tensions and provoking violence in eastern Ukraine, hurt and endanger all the people of Ukraine.",premise
Their presence is designed to safeguard the rights of all the citizens of Ukraine.,claim
we fully support their work,claim
"Russia is seeking to impose its will on the people of Ukraine by using misinformation, intimidation and aggression - tactics drawn from the darkest days of the past century.",premise
That is completely unacceptable.,claim
The Ukrainian people have the right to determine their own future free from Russian interference.,claim
The Ukrainian Government has stated clearly that its programme of constitutional reform will include discussions on the degree of autonomy devolved to Ukraine's regions.,premise
"That is a clear pathway to resolve differences through peaceful, constitutional means.",claim
The use of armed force that we are now witnessing in eastern Ukraine to impose one set of views on the peaceful majority is therefore entirely without justification.,premise
"Moscow must reject these latest unlawful actions, and do so publicly.",claim
"Since yesterday, we have seen the abrupt and simultaneous outbreak of violence in eastern Ukraine:",premise
nothing about it was spontaneous.,claim
France condemns the violence.,claim
We call on all parties to exercise restraint and dialogue so that a peaceful solution to the crisis quickly emerges.,claim
Everyone must work towards de-escalation.,claim
The scenario we are seeing reminds one of the events that took place in Crimea one month ago:,claim
"simultaneous action by a small but trained group of aggressive activists determined to occupy territory, followed by the presence of disciplined, masked men wearing uniforms and armed with weapons of war that are not found in military surplus",premise
"Those facts, which come to us through the waves of images on the Internet, are the same as the ones that Russia labelled a month ago as spontaneous demonstrations by local self-defence groups.",premise
Russia is unaware ofthe existence of the Internet and that it serves to contradict its denials.,claim
Let us not forget that such protests were a prelude to the annexation of Crimea.,claim
"Moreover, the build-up of Russian troops for several weeks now - under the guise of military exercises - casts an ominous shadow over eastern Ukraine.",claim
"Further still, the economic pressure is becoming more biting.",claim
"Without dialogue with the Ukrainian side, which it has taken by the throat, Russia has brutally raised the price of gas.",premise
"It blocks the entry of goods at the border between Russia and Ukraine, no doubt in an effort to stifle a country it calls its brother",premise
"Russia is systematically bombarding Ukraine with a message of defiance vis-a-vis Kyiv via the airwaves and television channels, which, for many people who do not have access to various sources of information, is the only message they hear.",premise
"It is against that backdrop that France commends the level-headedness of Ukrainian officials who, against that destabilizing torrent of events, seek to resolve the crisis through dialogue.",claim
"We encourage the authorities in Kyiv to continue their efforts for cooler heads to prevail, enter into a constructive dialogue and reassure people about their place in Ukraine.",claim
"The future of Ukraine should not, and cannot, be up to anyone else but the Ukrainians themselves.",premise
"We should support the Ukrainian authorities in organizing elections, under the best of conditions, that ensure that everyone is represented.",claim
Our message has always been clear that the presidential election scheduled for 25 May must be free and transparent and guaranteed by the presence of international observers.,claim
We reiterate our commitment to the territorial integrity of Ukraine.,claim
"We call on Russia commit to de-escalation and to condemn, along with the rest of the Council, the attempts at destabilization carried out by armed groups in eastern Ukraine.",claim
We also call on Russia to fully assume its role as a permanent member of the Security Council.,claim
"Russia is a guarantor of peace and security in the world, both in the larger world and in its immediate neighbourhood.",premise
Russia must today put its full weight behind helping Ukraine regain stability.,claim
It must show itself up to the task ofplaying the role it wishes to play as a pillar of Euro-Asian stability.,claim
"We hope that the proposed meeting on 17 April among Russia, Ukraine, the United States and the European Union will be held and that it makes it possible for solutions to emerge.",premise
we call on all parties to exercise calm and restraint.,claim
"The danger that now faces us is the failure of all our concerted efforts to build an international order that is not based on force, for today it is force alone that is seeking to impose the law.",claim
We are very alarmed by reports of increased tensions in eastern Ukraine in the past several days.,claim
We condemn the attack that killed a State security officer and wounded five others in the eastern city of Slovyansk.,claim
The perpetrators of that criminal act should be brought to justice.,claim
"After numerous calls for the de-escalation of the crisis, the situation has become more complex for the diverse Ukrainian community.",premise
It is imperative to protect the rights of the citizens of Ukraine regardless of ethnic background.,claim
"We reiterate our call for an inclusive dialogue, a frank and open discussion that is mutually beneficial for all the parties concerned.",claim
"Although Rwanda agrees in principle that Ukraine, like any other country, has a right to self-defence and to promote its territorial integrity, its acts should be proportional.",premise
We discourage any military act that would put the lives of innocent civilians in danger.,claim
Rwanda remains of the View that military action will only worsen the already tense situation.,premise
"We encourage all the parties involved, particularly in the current situation, to exercise full restraint.",claim
It is vital to allow the diplomatic efforts that have already been deployed to work.,claim
The international community cannot watch another crisis slip out of its hands.,premise
We must act on what we stand for - peace and security.,claim
"We welcome the discussion among the United States, Ukraine and Russia due to take place on 17 April.",claim
We encourage United Nations participation in those talks.,claim
"let me reiterate that the Security Council, the only world body in charge of maintaining international peace and security, must work towards restoring its own unity in order to be able to defend the unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity of a States Members of the United Nations, while addressing the interests of the countries of the region",claim
We recognize that there are political interests involved.,premise
we should not forget that ordinary Ukrainians are caught in the midst of this conflict;,premise
all they want and ask for is a peaceful country.,premise
"well-trained and well-armed paramilitary units have moved quickly to lay siege to, occupy and control key institutions in five or six towns in Donetsk province.",premise
The violence in Sloviansk has led to one death and nine wounded.,premise
The stakes are obviously dangerously high.,claim
"This has not been a spontaneous, grassroots, broad-based protest movement by local inhabitants;",claim
rather it is a pattern of highly orchestrated destabilization by pro-Russian groups.,claim
"Those groups have included units of highly trained armed men with Russian military equipment, operating without identifying insignia.",premise
Those units have used force to storm and besiege local Government buildings and institutions.,premise
it is because we have seen the playbook used by Russia in Crimea.,premise
it became clear that the militias were in fact Russian forces.,premise
We condemn any use ofproxy forces.,claim
A State cannot seek to avoid responsibility for its actions by attempting to cloak the identity of those working on its behalf.,claim
The principles of State responsibility make it very clear that a State bears international responsibility for acts undertaken by informal actors whom it engages on its behalf.,premise
but what we are actually witnessing is Violence and destabilization in an effort to manufacture a sense of crisis and separatism.,claim
Ukraine's response to those provocations has been one of restraint under intolerable threats to its stability and independence.,claim
There is no evidence of actions directed at Russian speakers in eastern Ukraine that could possibly justify an intervention by Russia.,premise
Nor is there the generalized anarchy claimed.,premise
Repeated calls for de-escalation have been ignored.,claim
Russia's major military build-up along Ukraine's eastern border has been a significant and deliberation provocation that only further escalates tensions and the likelihood of conflict.,premise
"It deepens Russia's own isolation and also, of course, strengthens the resolve of the international community to stand with and support Ukraine as it seeks to maintain its sovereignty and territorial integrity.",claim
"The only way forward, as we all know, is de-escalation, dialogue and the free elections that are planned for 25 May.",claim
And Ukraine must be allowed to prepare for those elections without the interference and coercion we are witnessing.,claim
But talks can take place only with genuine commitment and good faith on all sides.,claim
"The talks between Russia, Ukraine, the European Union and the United States planned for 17 April are an essential step in that direction",claim
Attempts to change the facts on the ground are completely contrary to dialogue and peaceful resolution.,premise
"We call on Russia to work immediately to reduce tensions, stop its destabilization and withdraw its forces from the provocative posture they have assumed on Ukraine's border.",claim
It now really is imperative that it do so.,claim
China is deeply worried about the recent escalation of the situation in Ukraine.,claim
"We hope that the relevant parties will remain calm, exercise restraint and avoid any further deterioration of the situation.",claim
Settling the question of Ukraine involves the interests and concerns of all parties.,premise
It should be considered in a balanced manner.,claim
Political and diplomatic channels should continue to be pursued,claim
in order to narrow differences and settle the issue within the framework of law and order.,premise
"China has consistently called on the international community to make constructive efforts and employ good offices to ease the situation in Ukraine, and will continue to support the international community in those endeavours.",claim
"We are deeply concerned over the escalation of tensions in various cities of eastern Ukraine, including the worrying seizure of key public buildings in Donetsk and Slovyansk by force.",claim
Those actions will only further exacerbate the already tense situation,premise
we condemn any use of force to change the situation on the ground.,claim
"As Ukraine moves towards critical elections in May,",premise
we believe that political differences must be addressed in a non-violent way through a legitimate process.,claim
there should not be any influence exerted by outside forces.,claim
"We reiterate our strong support for the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of Ukraine.",claim
"Chile regrets the outbreaks of violence seen in the eastern regions, specifically in Donetsk, Luhansk and Kharkiv,",claim
expresses its deep concern over the serious consequences of the escalation of the crisis owing to the actions of separatist groups.,claim
It is critical that the parties exercise the maximum restraint in order to contain the crisis.,claim
"Our country once again reiterates the need to respect the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine.",claim
It is urgent that all parties involved refrain from undertaking actions that are contrary to the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations and the international agreements and treaties to which Ukraine is a party.,claim
"We once again call on the parties to seek a peaceful solution to the crisis through direct political dialogue, to refrain from taking unilateral measures and to support international mediation initiatives",claim
in accordance with General Assembly resolution 68/262.,premise
That process must be inclusive,claim
"must ensure the rule of law, human rights, fundamental freedoms and full respect for the rights of minorities.",claim
"the role of the Security Council, the Secretary-General, his Special Envoy and regional organizations continues to be fundamental.",claim
today the celebration is falling under the shadow of aggression and bloodshed in Ukraine,claim
terrorists coordinated by agents of the Russian Federation seized control of State buildings in several cities of the Donetsk region.,premise
Let me quote a statement made today by Ukraine's acting President Oleksandr Turchynov,premise
"""A particularly dangerous situation has arisen in the city of Slavyansk, where professionally trained armed troops wearing Russian armed forces camouflage without insignia shattered the peace.",premise
"This morning, a convoy of law enforcement officers who sought to protect the citizens of Slavyansk were attacked with assault rifles.",premise
The criminals opened intense fire using local people as human shields.,premise
The blood of Ukrainians has been shed for one undivided sovereign Ukraine.,premise
That blood has been shed in a war that Russia is waging against Ukraine.,premise
"The aggressor has not stopped, and continues to organize unrest in the eastern regions of our country.",claim
It is not a war between Ukrainians.,claim
"The situation of confrontation was artificially created with the aim of weakening and destroying Ukraine itself.""",premise
the Ukrainian Government has done everything possible to avoid confrontation through an inclusive approach to each and every region.,claim
"the Prime Minister of Ukraine, visited the southern and eastern regions - Donetsk, Lugansk, Kharkiv, Dnepropetrovsk, Odessa * addressing such issues of concern as the language policy and prospects for decentralization of power and constitutional reforms.",premise
The Government is ready to consider the significant empowerment of local authorities in Ukraine.,premise
the efforts of the Government of Ukraine have been severely challenged by recent developments in the eastern regions.,claim
"According to Ukrainian intelligence data, during the past month and a half in the eastern regions of Ukraine, agents of the Russian special services embarked on large-scale operations to seize power and destabilize the situation, threatening the lives of citizens of Ukraine, for the purpose of separating those regions from our country.",premise
"During the past month, our Mission has regularly informed the Security Council and all States Members of the United Nations on the latest developments in Russian actions in Crimea and other regions of Ukraine",premise
Russia has not only been constantly increasing the number of its troops deployed along the Ukrainian border but it has also been sending subversive groups into Ukrainian regions in order to destabilize the situation.,claim
"Such specially designated groups, made up of 10 to 20 members of the special forces, primarily from the main intelligence directorate or general staff of the armed forces of the Russian Federation, infiltrated Ukrainian territory with the task of forming and organizing military combat units.",premise
"Ukraine has strong evidence of the involvement of the Russian special service forces, as was mentioned in a statement the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine made public early today.",premise
The detention of Russian citizen members of subversive groups coordinated by the Russian federal security services and military intelligence is carried out on a daily basis by the security services of Ukraine,claim
"On 8 April, Russian citizen Maria Koleda, who fulfilled intelligence service tasks to destabilize in eastern Ukraine, was detained in Herson.",premise
The Russian saboteur who was about to seize such strategic facilities as the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant was detained in the region of Herson,premise
"On 10 March, a representative of the Russian Federation military intelligence service was detained in Donetsk.",premise
"On 12 March, the intelligence group of the Russian armed forces that infiltrated the Herson territory from Crimea was detained at the control point.",premise
"On 20 March, a Russian citizen named Markhov, an officer of the main intelligence directorate of the general staff of Russian Federation armed forces, was detained in Chernigiv.",premise
"On the same day, a Russian citizen named Oleg Bakhtiar, one of the leaders of the Eurasian Youth Union of Russia, was detained in Kyiv as he was preparing a group of people under the guise of civil activities for the criminal seizure of the Verkhovna Rada and the Cabinet of Ministers.",premise
All of the arrestees confirmed being part of a network of persons conducting Russian subversive activities in Ukraine.,premise
"Intercepted radio communications of the aforementioned groups, and others, with their Russian coordinators are available and provide other clear evidence.",premise
"It has also been observed that such terrorist groups are heavily armed with weapons used exclusively by Russian armed forces, namely, the Kalashnikov assault rifle AK-lOO series.",premise
Those weapons have also been seen in the hands of Russian troops in Crimea.,premise
"It is clear that the tactics used by terrorists to capture admininstrative buildings in the regions of Donetsk, Lugansk and Kharkiv are identical to those used to seize the buildings of the Crimean Parliament and other Governmental building in Crimea, which video evidence confirms.",claim
Terrorist groups are acting in a very organized and pre-planned manner.,claim
One of the goals is to equip as many locally recruited marginal people as possible with arms and ammunition.,premise
That is why the primary targets of terrorists have been local offices of police and security services with weapon storage facilities.,claim
several hundred guns and automatic rifles have been seized are now in the hands of terrorists.,claim
"There is substantial video evidence of armed attacks using gunfire on local Ukrainian police stations, in Slavyansk and Kramatorsk in particular.",premise
have left absolutely no doubt that the terrorist groups are not the peaceful protesters that our Russian colleagues claim them to be.,claim
they are professional special forces appropriately equipped and armed by the Russian Federation.,claim
Terrorists have started using their weapons against Ukrainian law enforcement and military officers.,claim
This morning in Slavyansk the auto convoy of the Ukrainian military was attacked by gunmen using automatic weapons.,premise
"Terrorists shot and killed Captain Gennady Belichenko of the Ukrainian security services, while ""Alfa"" Commander Kuznietsov and Colonel Kuksa were seriously wounded, as was a police officer named Selikhov.",premise
We are not going to let the Crimea scenario be repeated in eastern Ukraine.,claim
We have not imposed a state of emergency as is required by the provisions of the Constitution of Ukraine.,claim
we have prepared a counterinsurgency plan to strike at the armed terrorists.,claim
"acting President Oleksandr Turchynov said, ""I would like to emphasize that those not involved in shooting at Ukrainian law enforcement officers and who surrender their weapons and leave seized administrative buildings will not be subject to prosecution.""",premise
And now Russia is applying the same tools,premise
inciting separatists by waging unprecedented anti-Ukrainian propaganda in the mass media,premise
distorting the truth about Ukraine,premise
"sending in special troops to seize administrative and law-enforcement buildings with the aim of destabilizing the situation in the eastern regions of Ukraine, and encouraging marginal groups to pursue their separatist ambitions",premise
threatening my country's unity and territorial integrity.,premise
"Apparently, through these attempts, they hope to disrupt the presidential elections in Ukraine scheduled for 25 May.",claim
but by sending its special agents to Ukraine to effect diversions and sabotage,premise
it is actually sponsoring terrorism.,claim
"Russia's statements and position are in fact supporting the terrorists in Ukraine who have seized administrative buildings, taken over the military arsenals of the Ukrainian secret services and police in several cities and opened fire on Ukrainian police.",premise
Ukraine is being subjected to a large-scale terrorist operation orchestrated by the Russian Federation in subregions of the eastern part of the country.,premise
That constitutes a serious threat not only to the security of the people of Ukraine but to international peace and stability as a whole.,claim
We consider it to be the Security Council's duty to find a proper and peaceful solution to this crisis.,claim
We once again call on our Russian partners to put an immediate halt to the actions aimed at undermining the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine.,claim
We demand that they leave us in peace.,claim
"but of course the most unfair of all came from our Ukrainian colleague, who accused Russia of terrorism.",claim
"Why did he not accuse those who terrorized his Government for months on end, up to 21 February, of terrorism?",premise
"They were people who really did terrorize the forces of law and order, who really did attack police and shoot at them and at those protesting against the authorities and seemed to be attacking their country.",premise
Why were they not called terrorists?,premise
they have been exempted from any responsibility for the criminal activities they conducted for several months.,claim
"I reiterate that, unfortunately, several clumsy accusations have been made against Russia.",claim
But why was there no response to our call at the start of the crisis for launching a dialogue on how to help Ukraine emerge from the political and economic crisis it had found itself in?,claim
Why was the crisis encouraged to continue?,claim
"It is true that the people in Washington, DC, to whom we did not send the letter, have already poisoned it for the European Union, calling it economic blackmail.",claim
"During the entire course of the crisis in Ukraine, Russia has never advocated aggravating it or destabilizing the country.",claim
"We have absolutely no interest in doing such a thing, since for us Ukraine is too important as an economic and political partner and a country that is very close to us in many ways.",premise
We do not desire its destabilization.,claim
We are not to blame for what has produced the results that we are now witnessing.,claim
Turchynov came the next day and did not seem to agree with him.,premise
It seemed they preferred to use force.,claim
"So, really, maybe somebody in Washington, DC, is thinking about Turchynov's military offensive scenario.",premise
"In which case, there is no need to accuse Russia of attempting destabilization.",claim
"And now, is the United States going to encourage the fulfilment of this criminal decree authorizing the use of military force?",premise
"Why, in one case, when it was a question of preparations to storm the residence of the President of Ukraine, the call was that under no circumstances should force be used, while in the current situation, it is to encourage the insane military actions that Turchynov's decree talks about?",claim
"Turchynov right now,",claim
because in a few hours' time things might take an irreversible turn.,premise
we have constantly encouraged such formats for dialogue as a possible way to achieve a solution to the crisis.,claim
"We agreed in principle that the meeting would take place among the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, Secretary of State Kerry, Ms.",premise
We very much hope that such a high-level meeting will encourage a broad political dialogue in Ukraine and show the way towards a political solution to the crisis.,claim
"Of course, that initiative is going to be fundamentally undermined if military operations are commenced in south-eastern Ukraine.",claim
"That would have extremely significant consequences, first and foremost for the people of Ukraine, of course.",premise
That needs to be avoided.,claim
the United States has constantly called for de-escalation and urged restraint.,claim
That has been our consistent policy.,claim
"Our consistent statements have made clear that military force is not the answer, and we have commended the Ukrainians, frankly, for enduring more than probably any country in the United Nations could or would endure without using force.",premise
"Therefore, there have been no shortage of efforts at diplomacy.",claim
"it is not the United States that has escalated the situation, it is the Russian Federation.",claim
"while we would like to place our faith in talks with the Russian Federation, the European Union and Ukraine, it is hard to reconcile the behaviour of the Russian Federation, the propaganda of the Russian Federation and the military actions of the Russian Federation - which range from the massing of 40,000 troops on the border to the subversive activities inside Ukraine - with their appeal for diplomacy and de-escalation.",claim
"a few times, the representative of the Russian Federation has described what is happening in the eastern cities as protests and demonstrations.",premise
they are not protests and they are not demonstrations.,claim
"They are professional forces carrying weapons - Russian-made weapons, as it happens - and carrying out sophisticated, coordinated military operations across a substantial number of eastern Ukrainian cities.",premise
They are not demonstrations.,claim
They are not protests.,claim
They are military operations.,claim
the credibility of the Russian Federation has been gravely undermined.,claim
"That will require that the Russian Federation pull back its forces, which are ominously stationed and massed at the eastern Ukrainian border",claim
It will require that the Russian Federation work to de-escalate the situation in the light of the armed takeover of those buildings.,claim
"If, in fact, the Russian Federation is interested in peace and in upholding its role as an enforcer of international peace and security, then it will engage quickly and with a wholly different degree of conviction, urgency and truthfulness than it has up to this point.",claim
"the people were speaking out against the banditry of the authorities, and now it is bandits who are against the people.",premise
There is a difference there.,claim
the fact that several hundred separatists are holding thousands of people hostage to fear in towns.,premise
"We see the standoffs on television in Kharkiv, Luhansk and Dnipropetrovsk.",premise
"small groups of armed people, headed up, inter alia, by agents from the Russian Federation, seize State buildings and take weapons to hand out.",premise
those are terrorist operations that have been specially organized and orchestrated,claim
"Churkin is absolutely right, there is not much time left at all, there is just about an hour and a half.",claim
"Why do they not call their people and tell them to come back, sit down around the negotiating table and decide together how we can establish good neighbourly relations?",premise
That would be the right thing to do.,claim
"The Government mentioned the referendum, changes to the Constitution, the retention of the language law and the fact that the problems that have cropped up over the decades and remained unsolved by previous Governments needed to be addressed at last.",premise
"That is something that we need to do, but we are being prevented from doing so.",claim
the representative of Ukraine is far too easy in characterizing his own people as bandits.,claim
The Right Sector and those who say the demonstrators should be killed are not bandits; they are simply the political elite of Kyiv.,claim
"I hope that, as the Ukrainian representative has called for, following today's discussion some Western colleagues and partners will pick up the telephone and call their leaders and those in Kyiv with whom they enjoy influence, who may not act unless they get the green light from Western capitals.",claim
we are deeply concerned by the deteriorating security situation in southern and eastern Ukraine and by the fact that the Geneva agreement of 17 April is not yet achieving its objective to restore stability in Ukraine.,claim
It is vitally important that the Security Council maintain its close scrutiny of events in Ukraine and the consequent threat to international peace and security.,claim
it is Russia that has taken further dangerous steps aimed at fomenting instability in Ukraine.,claim
"It has directed paramilitary actions in Sloviansk, Kramatorsk, Lugansk and other towns in eastern Ukraine.",premise
Russian military jets and helicopters have made incursions into Ukrainian airspace.,premise
Russian armed forces have held further military exercises on Ukraine's border.,premise
These are all clear attempts to escalate tensions within Ukraine.,claim
The Permanent Representative of the Russian Federation has asserted that Russia has a legal basis to intervene in Ukraine in accordance with the right of self-defence under Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations.,premise
This is a claim that takes Russia's distortion of international law to a new level.,premise
There is no justification or legal basis whatsoever for invoking Article 51.,claim
Russian nationals are not under threat in Ukraine,claim
"a fact that has been reaffirmed on numerous occasions, including by the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission and by the Commissioner for National Minorities of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).",premise
This is deeply irresponsible rhetoric intended to threaten and intimidate the Ukrainian Government and provide a bogus pretext for further illegal breaches of Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity.,claim
"As a result of Russia's activities, there has been a further marked deterioration in the security situation in eastern and southern Ukraine, as Mr.",premise
The United Kingdom condemns the abduction at gunpoint and public parading of an OSCE Vienna Document inspection team and its Ukrainian escorts.,claim
We call upon those responsible to ensure the safe treatment and immediate release of the team,claim
"we urge Russia, itselfan OSCE member, to use its influence to ensure that this happens without further delay.",claim
The United Kingdom welcomed that agreement and the opportunity it offered for restoring stability in Ukraine.,claim
But this opportunity has been spurned.,claim
"Since 17 April, the actions undertaken by Kyiv and Moscow stand in stark contrast.",claim
"First, the Geneva agreement called for all sides to refrain from violence, intimidation and provocative actions.",premise
"For its part, the Ukrainian Government has acted with commendable restraint when undertaking measured and proportionate security operations to deal with armed groups illegally occupying Government buildings and forming checkpoints.",claim
The Ukrainian Government has the right and responsibility to uphold the rule of law and protect both its citizens and its officials on Ukrainian territory.,premise
"Russia, on the other hand, continues its military manoeuvres and aggressive rhetoric.",claim
"Secondly, the agreement called for all illegal armed groups to be disarmed.",premise
The Ukrainian Government started to collect illegal weapons almost as soon as it came to power.,claim
There are now no illegally armed protesters on Maidan Square and no armed self-defence groups patrolling the streets of Kyiv,premise
"But in Sloviansk and other eastern cities, we continue to see, encouraged by Russia, heavily armed paramilitary forces armed with automatic rifles and rocket-propelled grenades.",claim
"Thirdly, the agreement called for all illegally seized buildings, occupied streets and public places to be vacated.",premise
The Ukrainian Government has been systematically and incrementally removing barricades around the Maidan and the protests there are gradually shrinking.,claim
"By contrast, Russia has refused to use its influence to restrain armed groups in the east.",claim
Foreign Minister Lavrov stated on 23 April that Russia will not call for these illegal militias to put down their arms and vacate buildings.,premise
"Instead, barricades and roadblocks in eastern and southern Ukraine have been steadily reinforced.",claim
"while Ukraine has put a draft law to the Ukrainian Parliament that would provide amnesty for protestors who vacate Government buildings and lay down their weapons, Russia has not rescinded the order by the Russian Parliament to authorize the use of military force in Ukraine and will not condemn the widely reported abuses by pro-Russian armed groups in southern and eastern Ukraine.",claim
"These abuses include at least 11 kidnappings, among them several Ukrainian and international journalists, and the torture and murder ofa Ukrainian local official and two other local people.",premise
The deplorable shooting yesterday of the Mayor of Kharkiv was another sign of the violence being instigated against those who have opted to support a united Ukraine.,premise
Ukraine has begun an inclusive process of constitutional reform on the decentralization of power.,claim
"It has announced measures to guarantee the protection of the Russian language, and it has condemned instances of anti-Semitism and xenophobia, whereas Russian rhetoric continues to whip up tensions with false claims that the Russian language is under threat in Ukraine and allegations that the Kyiv Government is anti-Semitic.",premise
"Having illegally annexed Crimea, Russia is now destabilizing southern and eastern Ukraine as part of its plan to undermine the ability of the people of Ukraine to determine peacefully their own future.",claim
it is threatening international peace and security.,claim
But the doors of diplomacy remain open.,claim
We urge Russia to abandon the dangerous course it is pursuing and to take urgent steps to implement the Geneva agreement.,claim
the Ukrainian Government is striving to take forward a programme of democratization and inclusive constitutional and economic reform that aims to correct the long period of misgovernment and corruption that preceded it.,claim
It is in all our interests to support this process.,claim
This is not about zero-sum game politics;,premise
it is about restoring stability to Ukraine and to the wider region and allowing all the people of Ukraine to determine their own future.,premise
We urge Russia to become part of this collective international effort.,claim
the situation in Ukraine has deteriorated continuously.,claim
"In several eastern cities, armed militants, acting in a professional and synchronized manner, have taken possession of public buildings.",premise
The similarity of the operations that were observed in Crimea is striking.,claim
The violence continues.,claim
Seven observers of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) were taken hostage on 25 April.,premise
They must be released without delay.,claim
the mayor of Kharkiv was the target of an attack and is in a serious condition.,premise
"We are witnessing a a subversive operation that has been planned, barely disguised and orchestrated by Russia.",claim
Russian special forces do not even hide anymore.,claim
"our Russian colleague denied their involvement in Crimea, while his President recognized it a few days later.",premise
he will do the same with respect to current events in Ukraine.,claim
France strongly and unequivocally condemns those unacceptable attempts by Russia to destabilize Ukraine.,claim
We must halt this course of confrontation and work towards de-escalation.,claim
"The joint declaration agreed on in Geneva on 17 April by Ukraine, Russia, the United States and the European Union shows the way forward.",premise
It calls on all parties to refrain from violence and acts of intimidation or provocation.,premise
"It provides for the disarmament of illegal armed groups, evacuation of occupied buildings and public places and amnesty for those who lay down their arms, with the exception of individuals with blood on their hands.",premise
"It is essential that the declaration be implemented by all parties without delay and in good faith,",claim
so that the Ukrainian State can re-establish its sovereignty over its territory.,premise
"The OSCE's special monitoring mission has been asked to play an important role in implementing those de-escalation measures,",premise
and it is essential that it be allowed to act without hindrance.,claim
since the declaration's adoption we have seen two distinct attitudes.,claim
"On the one hand, the Ukrainian Government has shown its good faith in implementing the declaration by drafting an amnesty law, launching the process of constitutional reform and accelerating the dismantling of barricades and armed groups in Kyiv.",premise
"I commend the restraint and composure of the Ukrainian security forces, who have responded appropriately to the repeated destabilizing actions they are dealing with.",premise
We can only imagine what any other Government would have done in the face of such provocation on its national territory.,premise
the Russian side has complied with none of the 17 April commitments.,claim
There has been no condemnation of the separatist actions that have spawned new violence and no call for public buildings to be evacuated.,premise
"There has been no appeal to the pro-Russian militants to exercise restraint and end their attacks on munitions depots and on their compatriots, some of whom are said to have been tortured, and on journalists as well.",premise
"Far from condemning those who took the OSCE observers hostage, today Russia is calling the mission's presence in eastern Ukraine a provocation.",premise
We are at a turning point.,claim
"With every moment that passes, the risk of anarchy and bloody incidents grows.",premise
That is why we call on the Russian authorities to choose the path of de-escalation through the immediate demonstration of respect for the commitments made in the Geneva declaration.,claim
"If the situation worsens, we will be forced to ratchet up the sanctions once again.",premise
That is not what we would prefer.,claim
"Our goal is to ensure the holding on 25 May of free, inclusive and transparent presidential elections, whose good conduct will be guaranteed by the presence of international observers.",claim
The possibility that the actions of some violent groups could threaten the holding of this democratic exercise is unacceptable.,claim
We also support constitutional reform that would ensure respect for minorities and some decentralization.,claim
It is up to all Ukrainians to decide their future.,premise
"Then history and geography can bring about an inevitable and desirable reconciliation between a democratic, peaceful and independent Ukraine and a Russian Federation that will renounce its dangerous nationalist illusions.",claim
"We believe, however, that the Ukrainian people and the international community will not judge us on the number of public briefings we organize in the Council or the toughness of our statements, but on our political will and how we use our influence to effectively help Ukrainians resolve the crisis in their country.",claim
We are witnessing a situation that is deteriorating every day and leading slowly to an open war that might involve countries of the region and beyond.,claim
the developments of the last few weeks are alarming and have immensely undermined the diplomatic efforts to defuse the situation.,premise
"We condemn in the strongest terms the attempt made to assassinate Hennadiy Kernes, the Mayor of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, as well as the illegal detention of the military monitors from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and their Ukrainian staff, which is a serious violation of the current agreement, and we demand their immediate release.",claim
we are concerned about the fact that many of those measures have not been implemented.,claim
"We urge all parties to implement their parts of the agreement, and especially to disarm all military groups and restore all seized buildings.",claim
"The OSCE monitors must be allowed to play a role and to fulfil their mandate, as stipulated in the joint declaration",claim
"Rwanda reiterates its call for respect for Ukraine's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity.",claim
"We believe in the right to peaceful demonstration, but we firmly condemn the use of violence, the seizure of public buildings and the installation of illegal checkpoints by armed protesters.",claim
"We therefore believe that Ukraine, like any other country, has a right to restore public order, provided that right is exercised in a proportionate manner.",claim
"Nonetheless, the crisis in eastern Ukraine is not merely a matter of public order but a political issue that must be resolved through genuine dialogue with all Ukrainian parties, with a view to ensuring sustainable peace and equal rights for all, including the Russian-speaking minority.",claim
"we reiterate our strong belief that while public meetings of the Council are important for its members to continue monitoring this crisis, the only way to solve the crisis in Ukraine is through the exercise of political will and the influence of all the countries and regional organizations involved, in order to ensure a political and diplomatic solution to the conflict.",claim
"Going over the difficult situation and the worsening of the crisis once again is undoubtedly one reason, although I know there are clear, decisive reasons behind the initiative of the United Kingdom to convene this meeting that brings us all together.",claim
Are we acting in the Council to help overcome misunderstandings?,claim
I am certain that we are.,claim
"That is, that in the dialogue of constructive diplomacy that was initiated on 17 April with a view to finding a peaceful and political solution to this critical situation, Russia, the United States, the European Union and Ukraine all expressed at Geneva a willingness to reach an agreement.",claim
we must urge the parties to return to a constructive dialogue.,claim
The difficult situation facing Ukraine cannot be resolved through unilateral actions of any sort.,premise
"It is essential that we strictly abide by the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and not intervene in matters under the domestic jurisdiction of States in any way, including military, political and economic.",premise
"The other reason we are here is to reject violence involving two concrete events, namely, the attack against the Mayor of Kharkiv, in eastern Ukraine, and, as requested by the Secretary-General",premise
Argentina calls for the immediate and unconditional release of the military observers of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe who are being held hostage.,claim
Again we reiterate that the Council meets in order to promote peace.,premise
we stand ready to help Ukraine emerge from this difficult situation so that it can achieve the peace that its people deserve.,claim
"On 17 April, Ukraine, the Russian Federation, the European Union and the United States issued the Geneva joint statement to de-escalate the crisis that brings us together this evening.",premise
Secretary Kerry also commended Foreign Minister Lavrov and the Ukrainian Foreign Minister for their cooperation in achieving that hard-negotiated agreement.,premise
It was a moment of hope.,claim
"Since then, the Government of Ukraine has been implementing its commitments in good faith.",claim
"Regrettably, the same cannot be said of the Russian Federation.",claim
"As we meet, observers from the special monitoring mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) are reporting that most of Ukraine, including eastern Ukraine, is peaceful.",premise
"The exceptions are in such areas as Donetsk, Luhansk and Sloviansk, where pro-Russian separatists continue to occupy buildings and attack local officials.",premise
There we have seen a sharp deterioration in law and order.,claim
"Just today, pro-Russian separatists armed with baseball bats, stormed the Government buildings in Luhansk, seizing control of the centre of municipal activity in one of the largest cities in eastern Ukraine.",premise
"That kind of thuggery mimics the seizures of police stations, city halls and other Government buildings in cities and towns in Donetsk oblast and surrounding areas.",premise
"In addition to occupying Government buildings, over the past two weeks, gunmen kidnapped a senior police officer in Luhansk",premise
"In Donetsk, pro-Russian thugs armed with baseball bats attacked peaceful participants at a pro-unity rally, seriously injuring at least 15.",premise
"Also in Donetsk, pro-Russian groups continue to hold 17 buildings, including the regional television broadcasting centre.",premise
"In the city of Sloviansk, the mayor was kidnapped, as were several journalists.",premise
The separatists in that area now hold an estimated 40 hostages.,premise
"Nearby, three bodies were recently pulled from a river, each showing unmistakable signs of physical abuse; one has been identified as a local politician, another as a 19 year-old pro-unity student activist.",premise
"Yesterday, gunmen reportedly chased members of the Sloviansk Roma community from their homes.",premise
Make no mistake: those are not peaceful protests.,claim
It is not an eastern Ukrainian spring.,claim
"It is a well-orchestrated campaign, with external support, to destabilize the Ukrainian State.",claim
"pro-Russian separatists in Donetsk have kidnapped and continue to hold seven international inspectors, openly declared as members of a Vienna document mission, along with their Ukrainian escorts.",premise
My Government joins with responsible Governments everywhere in condemning that unlawful act and in being outraged by the shameful exhibition before the media of those international public servants.,claim
"We call, with others, for the immediate and unconditional release of the inspectors and their Ukrainian escorts and the immediate end to their mistreatment while in captivity.",claim
"We also call upon Russia, as a signatory to the Vienna document, to help secure their release and to confirm publicly, even if belatedly, for the record that the abducted monitors were part of a legitimate mission on behalf of the international community.",claim
"Since 17 April, the Government of Ukraine has acted in good faith and with admirable restraint to fulfil its commitments.",claim
The Kyiv city hall and its surrounding area are now clear of all Maidan barricades and protestors.,premise
"Over the Easter holiday, Ukraine voluntarily suspended its counter-terrorism initiative, choosing to de-escalate despite its fundamental right to provide security on its own territory and for its own people.",premise
"Unlike the separatists, Ukraine has cooperated fully with the OSCE special monitoring mission and allowed its observers to operate in regions about which Moscow had voiced concerns regarding the treatment of ethnic Russians.",premise
"In addition, Prime Minister Yatsenyuk has publicly committed his Government to undertake far-reaching constitutional reforms that will strengthen the power of the regions.",premise
"He has appealed personally to Russian-speaking Ukrainians, pledging to support special status for the Russian language and to protect those who use it.",premise
He announced legislation to grant amnesty to those who surrender arms.,premise
All of that should be cause for optimism and hope.,claim
"what we have seen from Russia since 17 April is exactly what we saw from Russia prior to 17 April: more attempts to stir up trouble, more efforts to undermine the Government of Ukraine and statement after statement at odds with the facts.",premise
What we have not seen is a single positive step by Russia to fulfil its Geneva commitments.,claim
Russian officials have refused to publicly call on the separatists to give up their weapons and relinquish their illegal control of Ukrainian Government buildings.,premise
"Russia continues to fund, to coordinate and to fuel the heavily armed separatist movement.",premise
"just outside of Ukraine's border, Russia has continued to engage in threatening troop movements that are designed not to calm tensions, but to embolden the separatists and to intimidate the Government.",premise
I emphasize that the United States remains committed to supporting the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and will continue to uphold the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine.,claim
"We continue to seek stability within a peaceful, democratic, inclusive and united Ukraine, especially in advance of the upcoming important elections.",claim
"We remain committed to a diplomatic process, but Russia seems committed to destabilization and fantastical justifications for its actions.",claim
"The truth about what is happening in Ukraine should guide our discussion,",claim
because truth is the only foundation on which an equitable and lasting solution to this crisis can be based.,premise
The crisis in Ukraine is the result of a complex fabric of historical and contemporary factors.,premise
A political solution is the only way to end the crisis.,claim
"To tackle the crisis at its roots, both the current situation and the historical facts must be considered, taking into account the legitimate rights, interests and demands of the various regions and ethnic communities of Ukraine and the legitimate concerns of all the parties concerned, with a view to achieving a balance ofinterests for all.",claim
"For some time now, various parties including China, have been vigorously engaged in mediation efforts and pushing for talks in order to ease the crisis in Ukraine.",claim
"The Geneva agreement reached between Russia, the United States, the European Union and Ukraine calls for measures to de-escalate the Ukrainian situation, thereby sending a positive signal for a political solution to the crisis.",premise
"Regrettably, tensions in eastern and south- eastern Ukraine have worsened, with each side more vehemently accusing the other.",claim
Threats and sanctions have again replaced dialogue and negotiation,claim
"China hopes that all parties concerned will keep in mind the broader picture of regional peace and stability, and the fundamental interests of all ethnic groups in Ukraine, maintain restraint, persevere in dialogue and consultations, effectively implement the agreement already reached by all of the parties and continue to push for a political solution to the crisis",claim
so as to achieve stability and development in Ukraine as soon as possible.,premise
"China's position on the question of Ukraine remains objective, impartial and responsible.",claim
"China has called on all parties to seek a political solution through dialogue rather than confrontation, and we support international mediation efforts conducive to de-escalating the situation and seeking a political solution.",claim
The Republic of Korea is deeply concerned over the continuing tensions in eastern Ukraine.,claim
"Despite the agreement reached in Geneva on 17 April, the situation in Ukraine is showing no signs of abating.",claim
"We are troubled in particular by the continuing violence and aggressive provocations by illegal armed groups, including the seizure of key public buildings and the recent assassination attempt against the Mayor of the eastern city of Kharkiv.",premise
All provocative actions and hostile rhetoric aimed at destabilizing Ukraine must cease immediately.,claim
all illegal armed groups must be disarmed and all illegally seized key public buildings vacated.,claim
"We strongly condemn the detention of military monitors of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), as well as of Ukrainian staff by illegal armed groups.",claim
It should be noted that the OSCE monitoring mechanism is an indispensable tool for implementing the Geneva statement.,premise
It is unacceptable to target international observers who are working to de-escalate the volatile situation.,claim
They must be released immediately and unconditionally.,claim
The safety and security of all international personnel must be fully guaranteed by all actors on the ground.,claim
"In the light of the ongoing situation in Ukraine, we reiterate that constructive dialogue among all concerned parties will be the only way to achieve a peaceful solution.",claim
we call for all parties to the Geneva statement to implement their commitments.,claim
"As Ukraine moves towards critical elections in May,",premise
"it is all the more important to ensure the holding of fair and free elections in the country, without any intervention or influence by outside forces.",claim
"We once again reaffirm our full support for Ukraine's sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity.",claim
"We share his assessment that the situation in eastern Ukraine is deteriorating alarmingly, especially in Kharkiv, Luhansk and in the Donetsk area.",claim
"We are deeply concerned by the actions of the pro-Russian separatist militias backed by Russia, aimed at destabilizing eastern Ukraine and, it seems, preventing the holding of the presidential elections on 25 May.",claim
"These destabilizing actions have intensified again in recent days, with the proliferation of the illegal occupation of public buildings, an increasing number of attacks against the Ukrainian security forces and an increase in violence against the local population.",premise
"As others have already mentioned, just yesterday peaceful demonstrators in favour of the unity of the Ukraine were violently attacked by armed pro-Russian gangs armed with clubs and baseball bats in the city of Donetsk.",premise
"Today hundreds of pro-Russian demonstrators seized the building of the regional administration and the prosecutor's office in the city of Luhansk, and stormed the police station.",premise
We condemn those actions and the attacks targeting political figures in the strongest terms.,claim
"The torture and murder of the Horlivka city councillor, Volodymyr Rybak, whose remains were found last week near Sloviansk together with those of a young student from Kyiv, Yuriy Popravko, attest to the high level of violence.",premise
"Yesterday, the mayor of Kharkiv, Henadiy Kernes, was the target of an assassination attempt - there are differing interpretations with regard to the party responsible.",premise
These crimes must be investigated and everything possible must be done to prevent similar cases in the future.,claim
The violence of recent days shows once again the need to urgently de-escalate the situation.,claim
"We welcome the positive steps taken by Ukraine to fulfil the commitments set out in the Geneva statement adopted on 17 April by Ukraine, Russia, the European Union and the United States.",claim
"The Ukrainian Government has proposed an amnesty for those who leave the buildings they occupy in eastern Ukraine, as long as they have not committed crimes.",premise
"It is ready to launch an inclusive national dialogue on constitutional reform and decentralization, and has acted with restraint in response to the actions of armed militias in the east.",premise
"The international community expects Russia, for its part, to take concrete steps to bring the separatists in eastern Ukraine to de-escalate in accordance with the commitments undertaken in the Geneva statement.",claim
We expect Russia to use its influence over the separatist movements to convince them to seek dialogue with the Ukrainian Government instead of fighting.,claim
Russia should publicly condemn the actions of the separatists aimed at destabilizing Ukraine and call on armed militants to leave the illegally occupied buildings.,claim
"the withdrawal of Russian forces from the Ukrainian border is an essential step for de-escalating tensions, especially in eastern Ukraine",claim
We strongly condemn the kidnapping near the town of Sloviansk on 25 April of a team of military inspectors deployed under the 2011 Vienna document of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).,claim
"We also condemn the temporary detention, on 27 April, of two members of the OSCE special monitoring mission in Yenakiyeve.",claim
The safety of international observers deployed anywhere in Ukraine must be ensured by all parties.,claim
The OSCE monitoring mission must be able to fulfil its role in the implementation of the Geneva statement.,claim
"We call on Russia to continue to use all of its influence on the pro-Russian separatists to encourage them to release unconditionally and promptly the seven inspectors from OSCE participating States that they have been holding hostage in Sloviansk for the past four days, as well as the Ukrainian personnel accompanying them.",claim
We also condemn the restrictions on media freedom and on the freedom of expression.,claim
The detention and intimidation of journalists have increased over the past two weeks in the east of the country.,premise
"The day before yesterday, pro-Russian separatists took control of the regional public television station in Donetsk.",premise
"Dunja Mijatovie, has repeatedly warned against misinformation and propaganda.",premise
I would like to join her appeal and highlight that any limitations on the freedom of the press is unacceptable.,claim
"Nothing can take the place of direct, substantive dialogue between Kyiv and Moscow to find a diplomatic solution to the Ukraine crisis.",claim
The crisis continues to worsen.,premise
"It will have harmful consequences for the entire region, Europe and beyond.",premise
The Geneva declaration of 17 April cannot remain a dead letter.,claim
The alternative to dialogue and to de-escalation would have incalculable consequences for international peace and security.,premise
"Australia strongly supported calls for the holding of tonight's briefing to give the Council an up-to-date sense of the continuing destabilization and increased tensions in eastern Ukraine, much of which has evidently been sponsored and condoned by the Russian Federation.",claim
Ukraine is living up to its Geneva commitments.,claim
It has submitted to Parliament a draft law on amnesty for protesters who surrender their weapons.,premise
It has initiated a process of constitutional reform aimed at decentralizing power.,premise
It has committed to holding a broad public debate on possible constitutional changes and sought proposals for constitutional reform.,premise
It is working to disarm radical movements.,premise
The Ukrainian Government has also said that it will guarantee the rights of Russian speakers to use their own language.,premise
"It has strongly condemned xenophobia, intolerance and anti-Semitism and begun an investigation into the distribution of anti-Semitic leaflets in Donetsk.",premise
It has invited all political groups to discuss ways to resolve the crisis in eastern Ukraine and it has supported the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in its work to de-escalate tensions,premise
Russia's continued determination to promote instability and challenge Ukraine's authority over its sovereign territory.,claim
Russia's claims that it has no agency in or influence over the actions of armed militia groups operating in eastern Ukraine are not credible.,claim
"The seizure of OSCE observers on 25 April in Sloviansk and their mistreatment and their continued detention is a deplorable and cynical act against impartial international personnel working to bring peace and stability to the region, an act clearly intended to impede the ability of all OSCE monitors to work in eastern Ukraine.",premise
"continued and extreme provocations, including military manoeuvres on the Russian side of the Ukrainian border and reported multiple violations of Ukrainian air space by Russian military aircraft.",premise
the deplorable shooting on 28 April of the Mayor of Kharkiv and the abduction and killing of a Horlivka City Council representative,premise
"continued occupation of Government buildings by well-armed and coordinated paramilitary groups, including, today, the occupation of Government buildings in Lugansk.",premise
the increasing intimidation of local populations and illegal detentions.,premise
"increasing reports of violence, with people killed, wounded, beaten and tortured.",premise
it is appropriate and necessary for the Ukrainian Government itself to take measures to try to ensure security and protect its citizens in its own territory.,claim
it has a right to enforce the rule of law and respond in a manner proportionate to the circumstances.,claim
We welcome Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs Lubkivsky's statement during his 25 April press conference at the United Nations that Ukraine would protect its people from provocation in a civilized manner so as to avoid bloodshed.,claim
We welcome Ukraine's recent acceptance ofjurisdiction of the International Criminal Court (ICC) with respect to crimes committed in its territory from November last year to February 2014.,claim
We urge Ukraine to extend the ICC's jurisdiction to crimes committed beyond that date and to accede to the ICC Statute.,claim
"overwhelmingly, the international community remains united in its support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territory integrity and in its position that Russia cease its illegal intervention, interference and provocative actions in Ukraine.",claim
Statements by other Security Council members tonight are further confirmation of that.,premise
"Australia continues to call on Russia to meet its Geneva commitments, to allow Ukraine's elections on 25 May to proceed without interference or obstruction",claim
which is the right of every sovereign nation,premise
to exercise its influence over separatist activists in Ukraine towards those ends.,claim
The crisis remains very dangerously poised.,premise
"Active, genuine and immediate efforts by Russia to defuse it are imperative.",claim
"The Kyiv regime, spurred on by Western well-wishers, are stubbornly pushing the country to disaster.",claim
If our Western colleagues had actually demonstrated a tenth of that commitment to maintaining order during the events at the Maidan then perhaps the current crisis could have been prevented.,claim
"On 17 April in Geneva, agreement was reached that all sides should refrain from any types of violence, intimidation or provocation.",premise
"However, in just a matter of days, there was a resumption ofthe so-called counter-terrorist, but actually punitive, operations - out and out violations of that agreement.",claim
"In the south-east, there was a deployment of roughly 15,000 military personnel, tanks, armed vehicles, artillery, aircraft and subdivisions of Right Sector Banderists.",premise
"As the first attempts to bring military pressure to bear on the south-east led to the defection of some Ukrainian military to the side of the protesters, today the sub-units are staffed by those from the west of the country.",claim
"it became clear that they had no intention of implementing the agreement, just as they did not intend to implement the agreement of 21 February.",claim
that treachery led to bloodshed.,claim
"it is difficulty to speak of confidence in the current coalition in Kyiv when the defence and law-enforcement agencies are essentially controlled by the Svoboda Party, whose political platform is based on declarations issued by Nazi collaborators in June 1941.",claim
"I would recall that the collaborators and the followers of Bandera killed not only Jews, Poles and Soviet soldiers but also Ukrainians who refused to subscribe to their sloganeering.",premise
"the Right Sector Banderists, instead of laying down their weapons, headed to the east of Ukraine.",claim
"As was declared, the Banderist army crossed the Dnepr.",premise
Neither the Right Sector with its Nazi slogans nor any other radical organizations have laid down their arms.,premise
those groups have become legal.,claim
They are forming military battalions with names like Dnepr and Donbass in their ranks.,claim
the Maidan remains occupied - cement blockades are still in place - as are several buildings in Kyiv.,claim
No one has liberated anything in Kyiv.,claim
They have been rented by armed fighters.,claim
"the People's Governor of Donetsk, Pavel Gubarev, who never had weapons in his hand, remains in prison.",claim
"He is a political prisoner, arrested just because he called for a referendum on the federalization of Ukraine.",premise
The monitors of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) confirm that he was tortured and that he is now engaged in an indefinite hunger strike.,premise
Gubarev is far from being the only political prisoner of the Kyiv regime.,claim
One can speak of widespread witch hunts for those who have dared to express their disagreement with the Government in the Maidan.,premise
in the Donetsk region there are already about 10 cases of politically motivated kidnappings of people who were later transported to Kyiv by the special services.,premise
"On 28 April, there was an attack on the life of the popular mayor of Kharkiv, Hennadiy Kernes.",claim
My colleague from the United Kingdom rushed to say that the protesters in the south-east participated in that crime.,premise
That demands a careful investigation of the case.,premise
"Kernes had indeed spoken out about the chaos in other regions of Ukraine, and there were serious political battles between him and one of the heads of the defence and law-enforcement agencies.",premise
"On the same day - 28 April - at the Kherson airport, the presidential candidate's plane was blocked.",premise
He had been travelling as part ofthe presidential campaign.,premise
He was attacked.,premise
"In early April another candidate, Oleh Tsarev, was severely beaten.",premise
He was the only candidate for the presidential election without State protection.,claim
Tsarev was stripped of his right to participate in the televised debates.,claim
can we speak about the peaceful nature of the electoral campaign in Ukraine and of freedom of expression for its civilians?,claim
Yatsenyuk submitted to the Rada some sort of draft constitution.,premise
It is not really clear how it was prepared.,claim
What is certain is that it was not an open and inclusive process.,claim
"the Party of Regions, which represents the rest of the east of the country, was excluded from the process.",premise
It is no surprise that the draft was immediately criticized in the Rada by all sides.,premise
"We did not hear any reasonable answers to key questions, such as how the federalization or decentralization of the country would take place.",premise
It seems such things are to be substituted by some type of broadening of municipalities.,claim
"Instead of genuine collective work to bring Ukraine out of the crisis, which was brought about by political misadventurism, our colleagues from the United States and the European Union have preferred to make strong insinuations against Russia and thinking up some sort of sanctions that are pointless and counterproductive.",premise
"Perhaps they are satisfactory to some one, but the responsibility for the future of Ukraine, Europe and the world is not being considered - at least not by these people.",premise
The result is that the Government in Kyiv has done nothing to implement the Geneva document.,claim
"Our Western colleagues, first and foremost our American colleagues, which have an unprecedented impact on the situation in Kyiv, do not want, or have not been able, to convince the Government to uphold its obligations under the document.",premise
They must clearly understand the scope of their responsibility if the situation in Ukraine continues to deteriorate.,claim
"It is very difficult for us in Russia to see the chaos in such a close, fraternal country.",claim
But we understand the reason that brought about the protests in the east and south.,claim
People do not want a repeat of the Kyiv scenario.,premise
"They do not recognize the legitimacy of the Kyiv Government, which is made up of oligarchs.",premise
They have decided to create their own governing bodies.,premise
they have been accused of terrorism and punished by military operations.,claim
We call upon the Kyiv regime and its Western sponsors to think twice.,claim
"There is a need to lift the order on using arms against civilians, as well as to free the political prisoners and disarm the Right Sector.",premise
"A full constitutional process must take place, including representatives from all regions.",claim
"However, the most important work to de-escalate should be done by the Kyiv Government - as they call themselves.",claim
"On the OSCE monitors in Sloviansk, they were requested by the Kyiv Government, and as such were responsible for their security.",premise
"How can people be sent on a bus to an area controlled by self-defence forces, without even providing documents that would confirm their status?",premise
That was either a provocation by the Kyiv Government or just simple stupidity.,claim
"We are doing everything we can for the freeing of those prisoners, and one has already been released due to health reasons.",claim
our armed forces are on Russian territory.,claim
American forces are hardly at home.,claim
"They are in Australia, Lithuania, Poland and on the Black Sea, where an American vessel has remained longer than it was invited to do.",premise
our troops do conduct training exercises.,claim
But they do so in atransparent manner and while upholding all existing international agreements.,premise
We do not have any aggressive intentions towards Ukraine.,premise
"They Kyiv Government should keep a cool head and not engage in reckless activities with respect to the people in the south-east of the country, where there are many Russian citizens as well.",claim
the Geneva statement is just another document to be signed and discarded by Russia,claim
"adding to the growing list of breaches of Russia's international commitments, such as the Helsinki Final Act, the 1991 Almaty Declaration, the Budapest Memorandum of 1994, the Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation between Russia and Ukraine of l997 and the Charter of the United Nations itself.",premise
"Despite growing provocations, the Ukrainian authorities have taken a number of concrete steps to follow up on the Geneva statement.",claim
Barricades in Maidan Square are being dismantled.,premise
I recall my French colleague referring a number of times to the Internet and Google.,premise
Users of those will see that there is a significant difference in terms of what is happening on the streets of Kyiv.,premise
barricades are being dismantled.,premise
"The Kiyv city administration building has re-opened, as has the main thoroughfare of the city, Khreschatik.",premise
"Important proposals regarding the status of the Russian language, amnesty, greater rights for the regions, as well as limitations on the President's power, have been put forward by the transitional Governmet.",premise
"Indeed, as Ambassador Churkin referred to earlier today, constitutional reform was being discussed by the Parliament in a public session accessible to all.",premise
There has been a major debate on what was being proposed.,premise
"But, again, a major debate that includes criticism is a sign of democracy.",claim
"Unanimous decisions and acceptance of whatever is put on the table is something that abelongs to regimes, not democratic Governments.",claim
"It is necessary and it is something Kyiv has to do, and should be doing actively while involving all the regions and populations, because it affects the lives of the entire population of Ukraine",claim
"In a stark contrast to those efforts, armed separatists, aidead and abetted by Russia, are continuing their assault on Ukraine, adding violence to force and lawlessness to impunity.",claim
"As many noted earlier, yesterday and today saw more violent attacks in the city of Luhansk and elsewhere - in Mykolaiv and in Konstiantynivka - where men armed with clubs and metal bars smashed windows and doors.",premise
"A pro-unity rally was attacked by men in military fatigues, leading to over a dozen injuries among pro-Ukrainian protesters.",premise
"a Ukrainian helicopter was downed by a rocket-propelled grenade, hardly a weapon so-called peaceful protesters - as labelled by the Russian side - can buy at the local corner market.",premise
That certainly does not sound like the implementation of Geneva agreement by the separatists and their state sponsors?,claim
"Displays of brutal force, beatings, disappearances, torture, killings and hostage-taking have become a daily reality in eastern Ukraine under militant separatist rule.",premise
"While quick to condemn and brand Ukrainian authorities for alleged crimes, Russia has yet to issue a single condemnation of the violence carried out by armed separatists.",claim
"The legitimate right of Ukraine, to which our Australian colleague has referred, to defend its territory and its State has been exercised with incredible restraint and caution, although portrayed by the Russian propaganda machinery as a bloodbath and a valid cause for intervention.",claim
"If what Ukraine is carrying out in the eastern part of its country is a military punitive action, it is probably the most invisible, impossible military action on Earth.",claim
Nothing has happened in that sense.,claim
"in a threatening tone, Russia recently ordered Ukraine to withdraw Ukrainian troops stationed on Ukraine's own soil, or else - so much for respect for Ukraine's international sovereignty.",premise
We firmly reject all of Russia's attempts to validate its intentions and threats to use armed forces or to send so-called Russian peacekeepers into Ukraine.,claim
"As a permanent member of the Security Council, Russia should know better than to exploit the name of peacekeeping to cover up its aggressive expansionist aims.",claim
is sounding increasing alarm regarding the treatment of journalists and the deterioration of media freedom in eastern Ukraine.,claim
"In areas under the control of pro-Russian militants, journalists are attacked, detained, harassed and their equipment taken or smashed.",premise
There is probably something to hide if there is such a distaste and dislike of free media in that part of Ukraine.,premise
We reiterate our call to end impunity for attacks against journalists.,claim
"We also call for a thorough investigation of kidnappings, torture and killings, committed by whomever, and to insist that the perpetrators of all such acts be brought to justice.",claim
We also hope the report will look into the human rights situation in occupied Crimea.,claim
the Crimean Tatar leader Mustafa Dzhemilev has been barred from returning home to Crimea.,premise
A group of camouflage-clad men stormed the Tatar Assembly offices and tore down the Ukrainian flag there.,premise
The director and editor of Crimean Tatar programmes on Crimean State television have been forced out by local authorities because they had spoken against increasing censorship.,premise
"A new level of banditry by the separatists in eastern Ukraine was reached on 25 April, when they kidnapped a group of OSCE representatives.",premise
"Notably, when asked to release the hostages, the separatists were quoted as saying that they needed to speak to the competent authorities in the Russian Federation.",premise
My delegation strongly condemns the kidnapping of unarmed OSCE military verification mission observers and Ukrainian security personnel.,claim
"Such acts, as well as the public parading of the hostages,",premise
"speak loudly to the true character and intentions of the separatists, who seek to disrupt international observation so that they can continue attacking Ukraine out of sight of the international community.",claim
"The parties with influence on the militant separatists, first and foremost Russia, must take all necessary steps to bring about the immediate release of all hostages, without preconditions.",claim
"The international monitoring and mediation efforts of the United Nations, OSCE and other regional bodies must be fully supported, guaranteed safety and security, and allowed full freedom of access on all of Ukraine's territory.",claim
"those opposed to Ukraine's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity are at it again.",claim
"""We will take all necessary measures so that elections do not take place in the south-east",premise
"When asked what they would be ready to do, he said: ""We will take somebody hostage and hang them up by the balls.",premise
"It is real, you understand?""",premise
The intent here could not be more clear - it is to prevent Ukraine's return to normality.,claim
"We all understand that there are legitimate complaints in south-eastern Ukraine, borne out of decades of mismanagement and corruption and misrule, including the rule of the previous President, Yanukovych, who fled the country in disgrace.",claim
It is time for the current Government to start seriously addressing issues of socioeconomic development,claim
because a lot of that discontent is based on the socioeconomic concerns of the population.,premise
"Once those issues are addressed, the level of so-called separatism, I am sure, will diminish.",claim
"My Government condemns the actions of armed separatists and their external sponsors, aimed at further undermining and threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine.",claim
"The onus is now on Russia to stop interfering in Ukraine's internal affairs and fomenting unrest in Ukraine, and to abandon its threats of the use of force.",claim
Ukraine is doing its part to implement the Geneva agreement on Ukraine.,premise
It is time for Russia to live up to its own commitments and to reclaim respect for the Charter of the United Nations and international law.,claim
"It has been a month since Russia illegally occupied and annexed Crimea, using its military forces and brutally violating international law.",claim
"Unfortunately, Russia has not stopped there, and apparently its leaders are now targeting other parts of Ukraine and brazenly interfering in its internal affairs.",claim
"In order to implement the Geneva statement for the de-escalation of the situation in the eastern regions of Ukraine, the Government of Ukraine immediately took the necessary practical steps.",claim
"Within just one week, the Government suspended the active phase of its anti-terrorist operation, whose main objective was the restoration of law and order and the protection of civilians.",premise
It initiated constitutional reform.,premise
"It approved the concept of local administrative reform, whose main principles are decentralizing power in the country, significantly empowering local communities and improving management at the regional and district levels",premise
"A draft law on amnesty for participants in the uprisings in the eastern regions has been prepared and would apply to those protesters who surrender their weapons and evacuate illegally seized administrative buildings, except for those suspected of committing serious crimes.",premise
The parliamentary coalition has invited all political parties represented in the Ukrainian Parliament to sign a memorandum of understanding on ways to resolve the situation in eastern Ukraine.,premise
"The Minister of Internal Affairs and Security Services has continued implementing a nationwide campaign to seize illegal arms from the population, and more than 6,000 weapons have been handed over recently.",premise
Ukraine is demonstrating its commitment to constructive cooperation with human-rights institutions and international organizations.,claim
What has Russia done for its part of the Geneva document?,claim
It has done nothing.,claim
"Because of the lack of support for the separatists among the population of eastern Ukraine, Russia is seeking new ways to destabilize the situation in the region, preparing and carrying out numerous armed provocations through its agents.",premise
"Russian-sponsored illegal paramilitary units have continued to destabilize the situation in eastern Ukraine, preparing the ground for a new stage of military aggression.",premise
The Russian leadership has done nothing to publicly dissociate itself from the armed separatists and provocateurs or to urge them to immediately lay down their arms and release captured administrative buildings.,premise
"Russia has not even condemned the seizure of hostages, including journalists, or separatists' open acts of xenophobia and anti-Semitism.",premise
Any attempts by Russia to show that the Ukrainian Government is trying to use force against the peaceful Ukrainian population are lies.,claim
"Our Government respects freedom of expression and the right to peaceful assembly, which are guaranteed by the Constitution of Ukraine.",premise
"However, when heavily armed, professionally trained groups led by Russian military seize law-enforcement facilities and administrative offices, kill Ukrainian police officers and take hostages,",premise
they are operating like terrorists and must be treated accordingly.,claim
Ukrainian counter-terrorism operations are targeted exclusively at illegal armed groups threatening civilians.,claim
"Meanwhile, the Russian-controlled army groups are in fact holding the entire civilian population of several towns in the eastern region hostage and have thus transgressed the bounds of humanity.",claim
"Three Ukrainian law-enforcement officers were abducted, brutally beaten, tortured and later presented to the Russian media as Ukrainian spies, blindfolded and with their hands tied.",premise
"Ukrainian and foreign journalists are being systematically kidnapped, while Russian journalists are allowed to operate in the areas controlled by the illegal armed groups.",premise
A military helicopter was destroyed with a man-portable air defence (MANPAD) guided missile.,premise
It should be understood that peaceful protesters cannot buy MANPADs in shops.,premise
Representatives of the military verification mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) were taken hostage in Sloviansk.,premise
The detention by force of international observers is yet another testament to the criminal and terrorist nature of the separatist armed groups.,premise
"In contrast to the demand voiced in many of the statements in the Council today that those hostages be released, the Russian Federation, as might be expected, made no such demand; nor have its leaders in Moscow.",claim
What is important is that the leaders of the illegal armed groups have publicly admitted responsibility for all the aforementioned crimes * even on television.,premise
"Many members of the illegal militant groups are citizens of the Russian Federation, and they are not even trying to hide it, publicly displaying their identification.",premise
"We recently read an article in The New York Times in which the Kuban Cossack Mozhaev declared his presence and that of an armed group from his region, which we had noticed in Crimea as well.",premise
Ukrainian law-enforcement agencies have credible evidence of these persons' involvement in serious crimes.,premise
"Today, some ofthose crimes have been described.",premise
"Among them was the brutal story of Volodymyr Rybak, a member of Horlivka's City Council, and Yuriy Popravko, a l9-year-old activist from Kyiv, who were martyred by members of terrorist groups.",premise
"Their bodies, mutilated by torture, were found in the Torets River in the vicinity of Sloviansk.",premise
Volodymyr Rybak disappeared on 17 April in Horlivka after he tried to remove the separatists' flag from the building of Horlivka City Council.,premise
"A video of the kidnapping, as well as audio recordings of phone conversations intercepted by Ukraine's Security Service, provided sufficient proof that terrorist leaders, notably the self-proclaimed mayor of Sloviansk, Vyacheslav Ponomaryov, and the military commander of the terrorists, the Russian agent Igor Strelkov, were involved in the murder.",premise
"The true identity of the Russian agent has been established as Colonel Igor Girkin of Russian military intelligence, who is registered as a permanent resident of Moscow.",premise
"The Government of Ukraine strongly condemns the aforementioned acts of terror and violence, including yesterday's attempt to assassinate the Mayor of Kharkiv, Hennadiy Kernes, who publicly supported the unity and territorial integrity of Ukraine.",claim
President Putin now openly admits the use of Russian military forces and praises them for their heroism and the successful completion of the operation aimed at the reunification of Crimea with Russia.,claim
They have even issued a special medal of honour.,premise
"And now, in spite of numerous irrefutable facts concerning Russian military involvement in organizing and guiding illegal armed groups in eastern Ukraine, Moscow denies any Russian military participation just as hard.",claim
"Furthermore, Russia is now threatenting to use force, as demonstrated by its concentration of armed forces directly on the eastern border of our country.",claim
The number of units along Ukraine's borders has increased.,premise
"Last week, we all heard intensified militaristic rhetoric from senior Russian officials, including President Putin, Minister Lavrov and Minister Shoigu, threatening to send Russian troops into the territory of Ukrain under various pretexts.",premise
"Defence Minister Shoigu reported the start of new military exercises by battalion tactical groups from the southern and western military districts of the Russian armed forces in connection with ""the deteriorating situation in southeastern Ukraine"".",premise
the withdrawal of troops announced by Minister Shoigu yesterday has not come true.,claim
We still observe those troops near our borders.,premise
"Let me remind him that Ukraine has never threatened Russia, and never will.",claim
Ukrainians want to live in peace and to be left alone.,claim
"The highest level of cynicism is the Russian reference to the right of self-defence in a situation in which it is Russia that is acting as aggressor, having occupied Crimea, as is brutally interfering in the internal affairs of Ukraine, destabilizing it and trying to create an explosive situation in the eastern regions.",claim
"Unfortunately, we are deeply concerned that the scenario that is prepared for eastern Ukraine might be similar to the one implemented by Russia in Abkhazia.",claim
That scenario might include several steps.,claim
"Step one: a small group of local separatists, supported by Russian-controlled armed groups, would seize control over regional councils and make them illegally proclaim the creation ofa so-called independent Novorossiya within the boundaries described by President Putin at his recent press interview.",premise
"We have already seen that step taken in Donetsk, Slovansk and Kharkiv, against the will of the vast majority of the local population and against the Ukrainian Constitution.",premise
Step two: the Russian Federation would immediately recognize such a regional unit as an independent State.,premise
"Step three: upon a request from the newly self-proclaimed authorities, the Russian Federation would send its troops to Ukraine under the guise of peacekeepers or collective self-defence.",premise
"I must say that such a scenario is realistic, as it has been reported that some Russian heavy military vehicles had been spotted near Ukraine's borders bearing signs indicating ""Peacekeeping Mission"" in the Russian and Ukrainian languages, exactly as happened in Abkhazia.",claim
"One of the main purposes of that scenario is to disrupt the presidential elections scheduled for 25 May, which are a top priority for the Government and for the people of Ukraine.",premise
Twelve days have already passed since the Geneva meeting.,premise
Ukraine has done its utmost to de-escalate the situation.,claim
Our steps have been acknowledged and supported by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and other parties involved.,premise
Russia has done nothing.,claim
Russia has to implement the Geneva agreements.,claim
Russia should withdraw its army from Ukraine's borders.,claim
"it should make a high-level statement calling on its prote'ges to free all hostages, to disarm and to vacate all seized administrative premises.",claim
It also has to condemn all terror and violence committed by those groups and to disassociate itself from such activities.,claim
"Thirdly, it should stop its war-like rhetoric and start to act in a constructive and civilized manner.",claim
Russia must refrain from any actions aimed at undermining the 25 May presidential elections in Ukraine.,claim
"We call on the Security Council to give the most serious assessment of the actions and statements by Russia regarding Ukraine, and to take the most decisive steps to stop its aggressive appetite and to protect Ukrainian territorial integrity, which has been challenged once again.",claim
The only scenario that I would want to hear - but do not - is one that includes genuine efforts by the authorities in Kyiv to implement the Geneva document.,claim
"But the actions backing it up need to be taken, first and foremost, by the authorities in Kyiv, if that is what they are.",claim
"The Russian delegation called for today's emergency meeting of the Security Council with a view to considering the resumed punitive military operations undertaken by the authorities of the Kyiv regime, involving terrorists, the pro-fascist Right Sector and other ultranationalist organizations against their own people in south-eastern Ukraine.",claim
"A sub-unit of the Ukrainian army is using tanks, other heavy artillery and military helicopters to launch rocket striles against protesters and land troops.",premise
The first blood has already been spilled and reports are coming in about the killed and wounded.,premise
"If the criminal misadventures of the Kyiv clique are not swiftly stopped, a catastrophic outcome for Ukraine cannot be averted.",claim
We have warned of this on many occasions.,premise
"Punitive measures against its own people bear witness to the current Kyiv Government's inability or unwillingness to fulfil its obligations under the Geneva declaration of 17 April to ensure a speedy end to all violence and the launch of broad national dialogue, with the participation of all regions and political forces.",claim
it is now clear that the many statements of the so-called Government of Ukraine regarding its intention to begin nationwide dialogue in the search of settlement to the far-reaching crisis are nothing but hypocrisy.,claim
"The regime in Kyiv, having abrogated the agreement of 21 February, is now openly violating its commitments under the Geneva declaration of 17 April, which require an urgent measures to end to all violence.",claim
at a time when Russia is striving to de-escalate and settle the crisis,claim
"the Kyiv regime, with the support of its Western sponsors, has launched the full-scale use of military force, effectively annihilating any prospects for the implementation of the Geneva agreement.",claim
"We are particularly concerned about information that, in the course of the punitive operations undertaken by the Ukrainian armed forces and illegal ultranationalist groups, English has been heard being spoken on the radio and English-speaking foreigners have been identified among those attacking in Sloviansk.",premise
We insist that all outside interference in the events in Ukraine is unacceptable.,claim
"It is time for our Western colleagues to think twice, reason with their mentees in Ukraine, and stop toying with the destiny of the Ukrainian people to determine their own geopolitical goals.",claim
How else can we interpret yet another blatant example of the double standards wielded by the United States?,claim
"Following the numerous attempts of Washington, DC, to tell Russia where and how its military should be properly deployed in its own territory, the White House has now been offended by our appeal to the Kyiv Government to withdraw its forces from eastern Ukraine.",premise
"I recall that Washington, DC, used frequently to ask former President Yanukovich of Ukraine not to use force against his people, and threatened him with all sorts of consequences.",premise
"Now, however, in a strange twist of logic, force may and must be used against civilians by a Government that enjoys no legitimacy.",claim
"The High Representative of the European Union is not far behind her United States colleagues, philosophizing about the State's monopoly on the use of force.",premise
her statement can only be characterized as provocative and inflammatory.,claim
"It would seem that not only did the High Representative not participate in signing the Geneva declaration, but that she did not read it.",claim
the United States and the European Union bear great responsibility for effectively destroying the path to a peaceful solution to the crisis,claim
"the categorical refusal of Washington, DC, to support the continuation of dialogue between the representatives of Kyiv and of south-eastern Ukraine, under the auspices ofthe OSCE, would hardly seem coincidental in its contravention of the Geneva declaration fo 17 April.",claim
What could be a more striking example than the fact that the United States is bent on the use of force?,premise
"We call on Kyiv, its enablers and the signers of the Geneva declaration, the United States and the European Union, not to commit a fatal error and to make a sober assessment at all possible consequences of their actions.",claim
"We call firmly on the West to end its destructive policy concerning Ukraine, and on the self-proclaimed authorities in Kyiv to swiftly halt all punitive operations and other measures against the people, free political prisoners and guarantee full freedom for journalists.",claim
That would represent a genuine process of de-escalation.,premise
"There is a need for the urgent organization of authentic and equitable political dialogue, with the participation of all regions, to reach mutual agreement on the future of the country, rather than pretend to draft reforms within the small circle of self-styled Government of winners.",claim
Those who gave the criminal order to unleash bloodshed will bear full responsibility for whatever happens in Ukraine.,claim
the Council flaunts its divisions and hence its powerlessness while that unhappy country sinks into anarchy.,claim
"In eastern Ukraine, armed groups are gradually seizing the cities.",premise
They enjoy no crowds of supporters other than a few hundred demonstrators.,premise
Their heavy weaponry disqualigies them as mere sympathetic activists.,premise
Russian officers strut on local television.,premise
Observers of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and jouralists have been taken hostage,premise
"Numerous people have been detained; more seriously, increasingly credible allegations are surfacing of enforced disappearances, killings and torture.",premise
These thugs have refused to implement the Geneva agreement that was intended to restore the Ukrainian State on its territory.,claim
What has Ukraine done?,premise
"After showing a restraint that no other State would have exhbited in the presence of these attacks on its authority - attacks that have been organized, supported and justified by a neighbour - it decided to use its army and police against the armed gangs spreading a sense of insecurity at the expense of people most of whom do not support them.",claim
"These gangs have so little in common with the spontaneous coelescence of local groups that they were able to shoot down a helicopter with a surface-to-air missile - which, it must be acknowledged, is not commonly found at the Kharkiv market.",premise
By what right would anyone meddle in the internal affairs of a State that is only seeking to restore its violated sovereignty?,premise
"Russia has proven that by renouncing, one after the other, the principles underlying international life.",claim
"But it still has a few regrets as it spirals downwards, so it tries, against all credibility, to blame the other.",premise
"It invokes the agreement of 21 February, which it did not endorse and discovered only when it was too late.",premise
"It brandishes the Geneva agreement, for the achievement of which it made no effort.",premise
"it makes accusations that would be comical under different circumstances: the Nazis are in Kyiv, English speakers have infiltrated the ranks of Ukrainians - which makes me jealous that no French speakers are included - and, finally, the European Union is responsible for the violence.",premise
"In reality, Russia has opened a Pandora's box.",claim
They have let the demon of nationalism escape.,claim
They have unleashed bands of thugs on Ukraine.,premise
The only alternatives they are offering Kyiv are capitulation or partition,claim
we have been saying for weeks that we are seeking a de-escalation - we want a de-escalation.,claim
de-escalation implies that Russia will calm the armed groups it is equipping and training,claim
that it will see that the OSCE observers are freed - having still not publicly condemned their capture in the first place - and open negotiations with Ukraine,claim
that free elections will be held on 25 May under international supervision in order to give the Kyiv authorities indisputable legitimacy,claim
and that negotiations begin between Russia and Ukraine.,claim
Compromises are possible.,claim
"Ukraine is aware of the stakes and is ready, and the countries of Europe, the most closely concerned in this crisis, are too.",premise
Constitutional reform that responds to the concerns of the people of eastern Ukraine and respects Ukraine's sovereignty is quite conceivable.,claim
"we have to put an end to this bad spy thriller, in which the Minister for Foreign Affairs is replaced by an information service when a crisis has to be resolved.",premise
What we need today is not a vodka-loving James Bond but diplomats who can return to the principles that form the foundations of international life.,claim
The Russian Federation has described this morning's events in eastern Ukraine as a punitive military operation against peaceful activists.,premise
This is yet again a gross distortion of the facts.,claim
"The Ukrainian Government has the right, and indeed the responsibility, to uphold the rule of law and protect its citizens in its own territory.",claim
in doing so it should at all times act in a proportionate and measured way.,claim
"The actions undertaken this morning by Ukrainian security forces in and around Sloviansk appear to have been just that, in an effort to relieve the city from the armed groups, sponsored and controlled by Russia, that have been terrorizing the local population.",premise
We urge them to continue to make every effort to ensure that the risks to civilians are minimized.,claim
There is no Council member sitting around this table that would allow its towns to be overrun by armed militants.,premise
None of us would abrogate responsibility for the protection of citizens on our own territory who are being intimidated and brutalized by heavily armed groups backed by a neighbouring country.,premise
Proportionate is not the same as passive.,claim
The scale of Russian hypocrisy is breathtaking.,claim
"Russia stoutly supports, and indeed arms, the most repressive regimes in the world, notably Syria, a regime that brutally represses dissent without any sense of restraint or concern for the protection of civilians.",premise
Russia's synthetic indignation over Ukraine's proportionate and measured actions convinces no one.,premise
Russian claims that these are peaceful activists are simply not credible.,premise
"Peaceful activists do not have the means or the capability to shoot down three Ukrainian military helicopters, reportedly using man-portable air defence systems.",premise
"The use of such sophisticated weaponry against Ukrainian forces reaffirms our assessment that the armed groups in eastern Ukraine include professionals funded, equipped and directed by Russia.",premise
The situation in eastern Ukraine has continued to deteriorate.,claim
"Armed groups stormed the Prosecutor's office in Donetsk yesterday, further increasing the number of Government buildings occupied since the 17 April Geneva agreement.",premise
"We remain seriously concerned about the kidnapping and continued detention of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe's Vienna Document inspectors, and call on Russia to condemn this criminal act and use its influence over those who are holding the inspectors to bring about their immediate, safe and unconditional release.",claim
We are deeply disturbed by the reports of abductions and intimidation of journalists reporting from eastern Ukraine.,claim
what we are seeing in Ukraine is a torrent of disinformation and propaganda.,claim
"Three days ago, all the members of the Council emphasized the importance of the 17 April agreement and its implementation (see S/PV.7I65).",premise
Abiding by that agreement remains the best way to de-escalate the volatile and dangerous situation in eastern Ukraine.,premise
It is therefore regrettable that Russia's presidential press secretary said this morning that Russia did not think it any longer possible to implement the 17 April agreement.,claim
Worsening instability in Ukraine is in no one's long-term interest.,premise
"We urge Russia to step back from such rhetoric, to desist from its inflammatory propaganda and to commit to de-escalating a perilous situation.",claim
We urge Russia to throw its full weight behind the 17 April agreement and rein in the militant armed groups that it supports and that are responsible for the current crisis.,claim
Russia is pushing two monumental falsehoods right now.,claim
"The first falsehood is that the Ukrainians are carrying out a large-scale, uncontrolled, violent attack on unarmed civilians.",claim
That is false,premise
"The Ukrainian Government is carrying out a targeted effort to contain Russian-sponsored paramilitary violence emanating from Sloviansk, in an effort to deliver security for Ukrainian citizens.",premise
"There is horrible violence in eastern Ukraine, and that violence is coming, as it has been for weeks now, from Russian-directed agents and paramilitaries and their associates.",premise
The second monumental falsehood is that the Russian Federation is deeply concerned about the instability in the east.,claim
The rest of us are deeply and sincerely concerned by that instability.,premise
"But despite all its rhetoric, Russia cannot be, because Russia is causing the instability.",premise
"This expressed concern is cynical and disingenuous, and meant only to distract us from the reality that is playing out before our eyes.",premise
"From the outset, the Government of Ukraine has sought to resolve all issues peacefully through dialogue, both internally and with the Russian Federation.",claim
"This policy of restraint continued even after Russia subverted Crimea, orchestrated an undemocratic separatist vote in Crimea, invaded Crimea and announced to the world that it had annexed Crimea - while lying about its intentions and even its presence in Crimea every step of the way.",premise
"As its country has been carved up, as foreign operatives have moved into its homeland, as masses of Russian troops have assembled along its eastern border, and as Moscow has continued to threaten its territorial integrity and its people",premise
"Ukraine has continuously, day after day, shown remarkable, almost unimaginable, restraint.",claim
It has done as the Council has asked.,premise
It has implemented its international agreements.,premise
"It has refrained from military responses to aggression, even as Russia proudly announced that it had annexed part of Ukraine.",premise
Ukraine has over and over again committed and recommitted itselfto direct dialogue with Moscow.,premise
"And yet, in return for Ukraine's reasonableness, Russia has destabilized, threatened and terrorized.",claim
"In past weeks, the same scenario that played itself out in Crimea has been repeating itself in parts of eastern Ukraine",premise
the same sudden appearance of unfamiliar men and new armaments,premise
the same strategy of occupying buildings and taking control ofthe media,premise
the same vicious propaganda directed against the Government of Ukraine and the same denials of Russian involvement,premise
"and the same cries of outrage whenever Ukraine takes a step to assert its own rights, enforce its own laws, protect its own citizens and restore order on its own territory.",premise
"Their response is reasonable, it is proportional and, frankly, it is what any one of our countries would have done in the face of that threat.",claim
"Imagine for a moment if 26,000 square kilometres of Russian territory were seized by another country.",premise
"Would Moscow show restraint, week after week, day after day, in the hopes that rational dialogue rather than brute force would prevail?",premise
"How would President Putin respond, if parts of his country were seized, to requests to remove his army from those parts of the country?",premise
"Seriously, there is some irony in Russian demands, given the manner in which it would deal with separatism within its borders.",premise
"It has been 63 days since Russia began its campaign to annex Crimea, and for 63 days, day after day, the Ukrainian Government has chosen peace.",premise
"Yet in those same 63 days, Russia, day after day, has chosen to pursue more territory.",premise
Pro-Russian separatists have seized the Donetsk railway control centre and stopped almost all train movements.,premise
That is an illegal act.,claim
"Separatists seized control of the Donetsk General Prosecutor's office, in a violent clash that left more than two dozen people hospitalized.",premise
Separatists seized the General Prosecutor's office in Horlivka.,premise
Pro-Russian activists beat up two Radio Svoboda journalists who were filming a protest near the Kharkiv regional administration building on 1 May.,premise
"All told, in 17 towns in eastern Ukraine 32 buildings are under occupation, 21 by armed personnel.",premise
"In addition, we have seen dozens of Ukrainian public officials illegally detained, three bodies pulled from a river near Donetsk and a group of eight, now seven, monitors of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) abducted, in direct defiance not simply of Ukraine's Government but of the Council and the world community.",premise
"Alongside all of that action, we have heard the Russian Federation building its case for intervention - outright intervention - including President Putin saying that eastern Ukrainian cities and Odessa were not even part of Ukraine in the ""good old days"", harkening back to the glory of Novorossiysk.",premise
"And Ambassador Churkin has taken the United Nations Charter's name in vein by invoking Article 51 in self-defence, as activated during the Russian takeover of parts of Georgia and relevant here in the context of the crisis in eastern Ukraine.",premise
"The country that has a right of self-defence, Ambassador Churkin, is Ukraine.",claim
"Russia's military intervention in Ukraine is a clear violation of international law, and Russia fools no one by calling its troops ""peacekeepers"".",claim
"Unfortunately, Russia does have a track record of using the term ""peacekeeping"" as cover for unlawful military intervention and occupation without authorization from the Security Council.",premise
"There is no evidence that the Ukrainian Government has targeted Russian nationals or threatened Russia in any way, in stark contrast to the ongoing Russian actions to destabilize eastern Ukraine.",premise
Those separatists are not engaged in peaceful protest on behalf of their rights.,premise
Their rights are not being threatened.,premise
Their ability to use their language and have it recognized by the Government is not being threatened.,premise
Their ability to participate fully as voters and citizens is not being threatened.,premise
It is their methods that have been intentionally provocative and threatening.,premise
The separatists are not pressing their case peacefully.,claim
"They are using baseball bats, metal bars, clubs and knives.",premise
"Those are not activists, they are armed operatives.",claim
It must stop.,claim
"Since the beginning of the crisis, the Ukrainian Government has acted in good faith and with admirable restraint.",claim
The area around Kyiv City Hall is now clear of all Maidan barricades and protesters.,premise
"Over the Easter holiday, Ukraine voluntarily suspended its counter-terrorism initiative, choosing to de-escalate, despite its fundamental right to provide security on its own territory and for its own people.",premise
"Even today, as a it tries to lawfully restore order, Ukrainian security forces are operating in a cautious and restrained manner.",premise
"Unlike the separatists, Ukraine has cooperated fully with the OSCE special monitoring mission and allowed its observers to operate in regions about which Moscow had voiced concerns regarding the treatment of ethnic Russians.",premise
"In addition, Prime Minister Yatsenyuk has publicly committed his Government to undertake far-reaching constitutional reforms that will strengthen the power of the regions.",premise
"He has appealed personally to Russian-speaking Ukrainians, pledging to support a special status for the Russian language and to protect those who use it.",premise
He announced legislation to grant amnesty to those who surrendered arms.,premise
The fact that Ukraine has now taken some steps to try to restore order is to be expected.,claim
It is justified.,premise
"It is what each and every one of the States we represent would do in a similar situation, and would probably have done far earlier.",premise
The fact that Russia has chosen to call an emergency meeting in protest,claim
the authorities in Moscow either underestimate the intelligence of the world community or that they are trying to exactly replicate in eastern Ukraine the Charade that they were responsible for in Crimea.,premise
"Just as Russia and its pro-Russian militia allies engage in a dramatic and dangerous campaign in eastern Ukraine, the Russian Government is spreading some of its most wild propaganda and fantasy stories since the beginning of the crisis.",claim
"Over the course of the aggression, some of those entrusted with carrying out the functions of the municipal Government and those reporting impartially on the facts have begun to slowly disappear.",premise
"Local council members, local police and journalists are missing and being held by armed operatives.",premise
"International observers from the Vienna Document observation team, as the Council knows, are being held in hostage.",premise
Today's Russian Foreign Ministry ridiculous and false statement purporting Western intervention would not be so alarming if it did not suggest that Moscow is looking for nothing short ofa pretext to invade.,premise
"Russia may have the power to instigate fear, to spread lies and to sow discord, violence and disarray across its border.",claim
It may even have the power to abuse its veto at the Security Council.,claim
it cannot veto the truth.,claim
These are dangerous days for Ukraine and for all of us.,claim
"Russia must pull back its troops from the eastern border of Ukraine, it must cease its campaign of instability inside of Ukraine, and it must work to release the international observers and journalists who have been taken by armed men working on behalf of Moscow's agenda.",claim
"Over the past 63 days, in the face of aggression and annexation, the Council implored the Ukrainians to demonstrate restraint, and they heeded our call.",premise
We also asked Russia to stop invading its neighbour.,premise
"Sadly, it did not.",premise
"For that, Russia must be held accountable.",claim
"In conclusion, I reiterate the support of my Government for the principles of the United Nations Charter.",claim
We continue to support the scheduled 25 May elections,claim
which will enable the people of Ukraine to choose their leaders freely and fairly.,premise
"We continue to seek a peaceful, democratic, inclusive and united Ukraine.",claim
We remain committed to a diplomatic process.,claim
"Finally and most urgently, we call on Russia to cease its provocative acts and to fulfil the Geneva commitments from which it has walked away.",claim
The situation in eastern Ukraine is deteriorating in a worrying manner.,claim
Everything must be done so that it does not degenerate into an open conflict with incalculable consequences for international peace and security.,claim
"We are deeply concerned by the actions of pro-Russian militias separatists supported by Russia, who are clearly trying to destabilize the east of Ukraine and to prevent the holding of presidential elections on 25 May.",claim
"Faced with violations of its sovereignty and territorial integrity for two months now, the Ukrainian authorities have demonstrated restraint.",claim
They did not respond militarily to the occupation or annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation.,premise
"Until now, the Ukrainian authorities have shown the greatest of restraint in responding to the proliferation of cases of illegal occupation ofpublic buildings by armed militias, the growing number of attacks against Ukrainian security forces and the surge in violence against those demonstrating peacefully in favour of the unity of Ukraine in the east of the country.",claim
"We deeply regret that the confrontations today near Sloviansk and during the demonstrations in Odessa have led to deaths and scores of injured, according to media reports.",claim
"We reiterate our call for the de-escalation of tensions and for restraint on all sides, fully in keeping with the joint statement adopted on 17 April in Geneva by the chief diplomats of Ukraine, Russia, the United States and the European Union.",claim
"This is no time to tear up that agreement, but to uphold it.",claim
The loss of human life over the past few hours could have been avoided if all parties involved had done the necessary to implement the Geneva statement.,premise
The presence throughout the territory of Ukraine of impartial observers from the United Nations and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) is crucial for establishing the facts and defusing the war-mongering propaganda.,claim
Neutral monitoring and reporting of the facts will help create the conditions to de-escalate this dangerous situation.,premise
The OSCE special monitoring mission must be able to fully carry out its work to support the de-escalation measures set out in the Geneva statement.,claim
The safety of the international observers deployed across Ukraine must be guaranteed by all of the parties.,claim
We take this opportunity to reiterate our strong condemnation of the kidnapping of a team of military inspectors deployed under the OSCE 2011 Vienna Document.,claim
"We reiterate our call on Russia to continue using all of its influence on the pro-Russian separatists to free, unconditionally and without delay, the seven monitors from OSCE participating States, whom they have been detaining in Sloviansk for one week now, as well as the Ukrainian personnel accompanying them.",claim
Luxembourg continues to believe that a peaceful way out of this crisis can be found.,claim
Nothing can replace direct substantive dialogue between Kyiv and Moscow to find a diplomatic solution to the Ukrainian crisis.,premise
"For that dialogue to take place, we must urgently proceed to the de-escalation of tensions.",claim
Feltman's upcoming visit to Moscow and Kyiv will contribute to that.,premise
The good offices of the United Nations are needed now more than ever.,claim
"for Argentina, to reiterate - its concern that wide-scale violent confrontations could result from the growing tensions.",claim
"The alarming reports coming from Solviansk suggest that such confrontations have occurred and that there is a serious risk of entering into a spiral of violence with grave consequences for Ukraine, the region and the international community.",premise
Argentina condemns the acts of violence reported in eastern Ukraine that have claimed human lives.,claim
"the calls by the members of the Council, the Secretary-General and the international community on all parties to seek to calm the situation, exhibit the greatest of self-control and to contribute to constructive dialogue have not been heeded.",premise
The spirit compromise shown in Geneva has deteriorated rapidly and must be recovered in order to find a political and diplomatic solution to the crisis.,claim
It must be made clear to all parties that a peaceful solution to the difficult situation in Ukraine cannot be achieved through unilateral acts of any sort.,claim
"It is particularly crucial that all parties fully respect human rights law and international humanitarian law, respect the rights of all minorities and ensure that all actions are strictly within international law",claim
"The only solution that Argentina, like the rest of the international community, considers desirable and necessary is that reached through an inclusive national dialogue with the participation of all of the parties involved.",claim
"it is crucial to create conditions conducive to negotiation, build confidence among the various communities and provide assurances to all Ukrainians throughout Ukraine that their main concerns will be addressed, with full respect for Ukraine's right to see to its internal affairs.",claim
"We have witnessed further confrontational rhetoric once again, speeches fomenting hate, discrimination, hostility and violence, and actions",premise
serve only to escalate the already highly volatile situation,claim
All of this seriously undermines any effort by the international community to encourage the parties to enter into constructive dialogue towards a peaceful politico-diplomatic solution to the crisis.,premise
"It is therefore crucial that the most influential actors engage in constructive diplomacy, refrain from confrontational rhetoric and use their influence on the parties for progress in the effective implementation of the measures agreed on 17 April in Geneva.",claim
"Those measures are necessary, indeed indispensable, for de-escalating tensions and finding a way out of the cr1s1s.",claim
"Finally, human lives are at stake and regional stability is at risk.",premise
"Respect for the founding principles of the Charter of the United Nations must be ensured, including the universal principles of the territorial integrity, sovereignty and political independence of Ukraine.",claim
"The Security Council has met several times in a short period to address this situation, but we have not manifested the capacity to play a constructive role to find a way out of the crisis.",premise
"Members' calls to de-escalate tensions, exercise restraint and pursue dialogue have no effect because they are not coherent.",premise
We have not been able to send out a message in a single voice or to take any sort of action.,premise
But it is not too late.,claim
The worst can still be averted.,claim
"Perhaps the Council will - it should - be able to send the same message today as the one the Secretary-General made today, in the same terms, in the same spirit and with the same convictions, that is, that we must assume our responsibility to maintain international peace and security.",claim
"When we met on 29 April on the situation in Ukraine (see S/PV.7l65), we urged Russia to abide by the commitments it made in Geneva on 17 April, including to refrain from violence, intimidation and provocative actions.",premise
"Since then, as Under-Secretary-General Feltman has just told us, the situation has further deteriorated severely.",premise
This planned and coordinated destabilization could not happen without external support.,claim
The shooting down of Ukrainian helicopters in Sloviansk today by surface-to-air missiles is dramatic further evidence of that.,premise
"We are witnessing well-armed, well-trained personnel, using military weapons, who are intent on armed provocation.",claim
"We have seen further takeover and consolidation of control by armed militia groups over key facilities in cities and towns right across eastern Ukraine, including Donetsk, Kharkiv, Mariupol, Sloviansk and Holivka.",premise
Orchestrated violence has today spread to Odessa.,premise
Journalists in eastern Ukraine have been detained.,premise
There are kidnappings and torture.,premise
"The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe observers, detained on 25 April, are still being held hostage a week later.",premise
"That is an affront to the entire international community, and they must be released immediately.",claim
Those actions by pro-Russian groups are clearly not a legitimate protest or an attempt to protect Russian speakers from alleged or spurious threats.,claim
"They are calculated, cynical and highly provocative actions, obviously designed to undermine Ukrainian State authority, to intimidate and de-stabilize.",claim
They make a mockery of what Russia has committed to in the Geneva agreement.,claim
Ukraine itself is working to implement its Geneva commitments.,claim
It has submitted to Parliament a draft law and amnesty for protesters who surrender their weapons.,premise
It has initiated a process of constitutional reform aimed at decentralizing power.,premise
It has committed to holding a broad public debate on possible constitutional change.,premise
"However, in response to the extreme provocation that Ukraine is facing, Ukrainian authorities have the right and responsibility to seek to reinstate State authority and restore public order over all their territory.",claim
"Ukrainian authorities have given clear messages to militant groups as to what is required ofthem, as Interior Minister Avakov has said: ""Free the hostages",premise
Lay down weapons.,premise
"Vacate administrative buildings, and get municipal infrastructure back to normal"".",premise
That has not happened.,premise
"In these circumstances, it is appropriate and necessary for the Ukrainian Government to take measures to try to ensure security and protect its own citizens in its own territory.",claim
"We have seen a statement from Russia's Foreign Ministry earlier today describing - hypocritically, shamelessly - the policy of those who have supported Ukraine as ""destructive"".",premise
"But what is destructive is Russia's reckless interference in its neighbour's affairs - destructive of Ukraine's stability and territorial integrity, destructive of the Geneva agreement, destructive of regional security, destructive of the Charter of the United Nations and the laws governing relations between countries and destructive of Russia's own standing and credibility.",claim
"Russia must immediately de-escalate the situation, ensure that militia groups desist in their armed rebellion, implement the Geneva agreement and demonstrate, as President Putin has claimed, that it has no further territorial ambitions on Ukraine.",claim
That certainly does not appear to be the case.,claim
"In recent days, the situation in some areas in south-eastern Ukraine has been characterized by ongoing tensions and escalation that have resulted in casualties.",premise
That is a matter of deep concern to China.,claim
"We hope that the parties concerned will proceed from the need to safeguard the fundamental interests of various ethnic groups in Ukraine, maintain regional peace and stability, keep calm, exercise restraint and avoid further deterioration of the situation.",claim
A political solution is the only way out of the crisis in Ukraine.,claim
"A fundamental settlement to the crisis in Ukraine needs to take into consideration the history and the reality, and accommodate the legitimate rights, interests and aspirations of various regions and ethnic groups within Ukraine, as well as the legitimate concerns of all parties, so as to achieve a balance of their interests.",premise
"For some time, various parties, including China, have worked actively to promote peace and facilitate negotiations.",claim
"The four-party talks in Geneva among the Russian Federation, the United States, the European Union and Ukraine agreed on the need to take measures to de-escalate the situation in Ukraine.",premise
"We hope that the parties concerned will stick to dialogue and consultations, effectively implement the agreements reached, forcefully promote the process of political settlement and achieve stability and development in Ukraine as soon as possible.",claim
"China calls on all parties to seek a political settlement to the question of Ukraine through dialogue, not confrontation.",claim
We will continue to support international good offices,claim
that will help to de-escalate the situation and promote a political settlement.,premise
"What would a country do if a group of people in one of its towns decided to break away and declare themselves above the country's laws and Constitution, arm themselves illegally and attack local Government, administrative and justice buildings and take hostages and practice enforced disappearances, beatings and killings?",premise
"If such groups were supported by sponsors from abroad and propped up by massive propaganda campaigns demonizing the people and the Government, and if provocations were expanding into other regions of one's country, would one sit and wait for the country to be decimated, or would one act in the country's interest, protecting its sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity?",premise
Ukraine has taken belated and highly cautious actions against those who are determined to carve it up and parcel it out.,premise
"Like any other State represented in this Chamber, it has the right to protect its unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity by all means necessary.",claim
There were more victims on Thursday in Aleppo after a market bombing by barrel bombs: at least 33 people were killed and many more were wounded.,premise
"That took place a day after a barrel bomb was dropped by a Government aircraft on an elementary school in another part of the city, killing at least 20 other people, including 17 children.",premise
"Russia has so far not condemned that punitive act by the Al-Assad regime, like countless similar acts by the regime in the course of more then three years of ongoing war in that country.",premise
"Today in eastern Ukraine, two Ukrainian helicopters were shot down by mobile air defence systems, killing two military officers and injuring seven others.",premise
Another army helicopter was also damaged.,premise
Militants used grenade launchers and portable air defence systems.,premise
"Peaceful protesters do not use grenade launchers that can shoot down helicopters, or perhaps planes at some time in the future.",claim
Peaceful protesters do not take their morning walks armed with heavy weapons and automatic weapons.,claim
They do not kidnap and shamelessly parade international observers.,claim
"Today provocations and instigations are being carried out in yet another city in Ukraine, as our Australian colleague has mentioned, and there have now been deaths in Odessa.",premise
"Had the separatists respected and carried out the Geneva statement, had they not taken up arms against their own State in the first place",premise
none of that would be happening.,claim
It would not be happening,claim
"had Russia, the only Power with real influence on the separatists, denounced such acts of aggression and called on the separatists to accept a peaceful path of talks with the central Government.",premise
"Instead, Russia chose to continue to put the blame on Ukraine, the only side that is actually taking some steps - at gunpoint - to implement the Geneva statement.",premise
"In addition to the various initiatives that were referred to a couple ofdays ago during the Council's open briefing (see S/PV.7165) - an amnesty law, a limitation of presidential powers, decentralization - Ukraine's Prime Minister, Arseniy Yatsenyuk, has now announced that the Government will submit a draft law to the Parliament on a referendum on national unity, territorial integrity and decentralization, to be held on 25 May together with the presidential elections.",premise
"He again stressed that decentralization would grant, in certain territories, additional guarantees to the Russian-speaking population, as well as to members of ethnic minorities.",premise
people in eastern and southern Ukraine do not really know that such initiatives even exist,claim
"an aggressive propaganda machine has drowned out the voice of Kyiv, with its alternative narrative of Ukraine's demonization.",premise
They simply will not be allowed to know that viable alternatives exist to the path of war,claim
"because that is not in the plans of those who cannot wait to disrupt the 25 May elections and proceed with Ukraine's dismemberment, under false referendums, the so-called ""will of the people"" or any sham pretext still in use by pro-Russian militants and their State sponsors.",premise
"My Government condemns all attempts to destroy Ukraine's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, and firmly rejects all Russian attempts to validate its intentions and threats to use armed forces or to send Russian Federation peacekeepers into Ukraine's territory.",claim
we expressed support for the Secretary-General's initiatives and called for stepping up international mediation efforts.,premise
We now welcome the fact that Under-Secretary-General Feltman will be going to the region.,premise
We fully stand behind the efforts to de-escalate the situation.,claim
"We also think, as the representative of Luxembourg has stated, that the international observers who are there to provide unbiased, objective information must be allowed to work across all of Ukraine's territory, in order to help us all better understand what is happening there, but also to help in de-escalating the situation before it becomes much worse.",premise
The international community must mobilize to prevent the crisis from turning into a real bloodbath.,claim
"For we have seen, time and again, how deadly, horrifying and inhuman the results of incitement and demonizing the other can be.",claim
"We have seen it in South Sudan, in the Central African Republic and elsewhere.",premise
"In a tragic twist of irony, in the middle of Europe two sisterly nations, two Slavic Orthodox nations, may start killing each other, both victims of ruthless manipulation through propaganda, orchestrated by the Kremlin.",premise
The Geneva statement is the only thing we have on the table now.,premise
We should go back to it.,claim
We hae to let it work.,claim
It is in the interests of all of us.,premise
"Jordan would like to express its deep concern about the most recent developments in Sloviansk in the east of Ukraine, in addition to the spillover violence in other regions of the country, including in Odessa.",premise
We call upon all parties to demonstrate restraint.,claim
We call for a return to calm and for de-escalation and full cooperation with the monitors affiliated with the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).,claim
"We reiterate our appeal for the release of all hostages held by rebels in Sloviansk, including the OSCE monitors.",claim
"What is happening today in the east of Ukraine is not civil war, but rather a mutiny.",claim
"The actions of the rebels, including the ongoing occupation of seized Government buildings, the use of force, the intimidation of civilians and threats to their life and security, are in violation of the law.",premise
the continuation of those actions runs counter to the letter and spirit of the Geneva agreement signed in April.,premise
"We reaffirm Ukraine's right to take appropriate and effective measures to halt violations in the eastern part of the country, preserve its unity and sovereignty, safeguard the security of its citizens and uphold constitutional and legal order.",claim
we call upon the Ukrainian Government to work towards a peaceful solution to the crisis and respect international norms in dealing with the situation.,claim
It is important to uphold the relevant human rights principles and to spare no effort in immediately engaging in dialogue with stakeholders to reach a peaceful solution.,claim
We must not lose the opportunity brought about by the Geneva agreement,claim
which is a guarantee for calm in the east of the country and for preserving the territorial unity of Ukraine.,premise
We appeal to the stakeholders to implement the agreement and bring pressure to bear on the rebels to end the crisis.,claim
Rebels and all active stakeholders in Ukraine should refrain from racist or hate speech.,claim
There is a need to guarantee a return to stability in the country.,premise
We call upon all players to help the Ukrainian authorities in their efforts to guarantee success on the political transition process and to start a comprehensive and direct dialogue with all linguistic groups.,claim
"we underscore the importance of respecting the legitimate aspirations of the Ukrainian people and of working tirelessly to ensure that presidential elections are held within the set time frame in May, in line with those aspirations and while ensuring the future that Ukrainian citizens deserve, within the framework of a comprehensive, effective and lasting political process.",claim
The situation in Ukraine has further deteriorated in the past few hours.,claim
Ukrainian forces have launched operations against the separatist militants in the eastern part of the city of Sloviansk.,premise
"The rebels have continued to seize public building in cities in eastern Ukraine, mainly in Sloviansk and Donetsk, where the Prosecutor's office is even occupied by the militants.",premise
"They even shot down two Ukrainian helicopters on Friday, killing two crew members.",premise
"In the meantime, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) military observers are still being illegally detained by separatist militants.",premise
"We are of course deeply concerned by all those developments, which further deteriorate the already delicate situation in eastern Ukraine.",claim
We strongly condemn the violent methods used by armed separatists and we call for a proportionate response by the Ukrainian forces.,claim
we should put our full support behind the good offices of the Secretary-General in resolving the crisis in Ukraine.,claim
"I call upon all Council members to trust him, to trust his envoys and to give them the means and the political backing necessary to conduct a meaningful mediation in Ukraine and the region.",claim
The strongest condemnation of Rwanda or of any other Council member on the deterioration of the crisis will not solve the Ukrainian conflict.,premise
"We all know that only a genuine dialogue by the Ukrainian parties, on the basis of the 17 April Geneva outcome, and a strong commitment on the part of of those who have influence on them, who need to ensure that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine are preserved, can solve this crisis.",claim
"Otherwise, the situation will further escalate, the conflict will become regional, or worse, and it would be useless to continue to convene emergency public briefings of the Security Council if the concerned parties and countries are not willing to be responsible and solve the conflict.",premise
"In that regard, we need to scale down the rhetoric.",claim
The Republic of Korea is deeply concerned about the continuing tensions in eastern Ukraine.,claim
"Despite the agreement reached in Geneva on 17 April, the situation in Ukraine is showing no signs of abating.",premise
"We are particularly alarmed by the fresh violence that erupted in Sloviansk over night, including violent attacks targeting two Government helicopters by illegal armed groups.",premise
We strongly condemn those attacks,claim
which resulted in the death of two Ukrainians.,premise
Such instances point to a serious deterioration in the situation.,premise
All provocative actions and hostile rhetoric aimed at destabilizing Ukraine must cease immediately.,claim
"In the light of the ongoing situation in Ukraine, we reiterate that constructive dialogue among all concerned parties will be the only way to achieve a peaceful solution.",claim
we call for all parties to the Geneva statement to implement their commitments.,claim
We also fully support the Secretary-General's good offices and diplomatic initiatives.,claim
We hope that Under-Secretary-General Feltman's upcoming visit to Ukraine and Russia will contribute to a de-escalating of tensions on the ground.,premise
it is still all the more important to ensure the environment is conducive to fair and free elections in the country without any intervention or influence by outside forces.,claim
We hope that the Ukrainian Government will lead a inclusive and transparent constitutional process.,claim
"We once again reaffirm our full support for Ukraine's sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity.",claim
"Ukraine remains committed to the implementation of the agreements reached at the meeting of the Foreign Ministers of Ukraine, the Russian Federation, the European Union and the United States in Geneva on 17 April.",claim
Free and fair presidential elections on 25 May remain a top priority of the Government of Ukraine.,premise
We reject all attempts by Russia to blame the Government of Ukraine for allegedly failing to implement the agreements.,claim
despite numerous calls by the international community,premise
the Russian Federation has made no efforts to de-escalate the situation and implement the Geneva agreement.,claim
Russia strongly supports illegal militant groups operating in the eastern region of Ukraine,claim
"endangering civilians, seizing hostages and creating an atmosphere of terror and violence.",premise
"Security, as well as the protection of the rights and fundamental freedoms of all the people of Ukraine, remains a top priority for the Government of Ukraine.",premise
"the purpose of the counter-terrorist operation, the active phase of which has been renewed in Sloviansk, is to isolate illegal militants from the civilian population of the city.",claim
"The commander of the counter-terrorist operation has ordered the heavily armed illegal militants to immediately free all hostages, including monitors of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, to evacuate all seized administrative buildings and to stop the violence and massacres.",premise
The Ukrainian authorities are ready to provide amnesty to all those members of militant groups who have not committed serious crimes.,premise
Inclusive political dialogue with peaceful protesters remains a top priority for the Ukrainian Government.,premise
We officially state that no tanks or missiles are used against civilians.,claim
Russian statements about the participation of non-governmental armed groups in the counter-terrorist operation are not true.,claim
Russian statements as to the involvement of English-speaking foreigners are absolutely cynical and false.,claim
We officially state that the only foreign military personnel in eastern Ukraine are Russian saboteurs and mercenaries.,claim
"The Ukrainian side, as well as the Russian Embassy in Kyiv, was not duly informed about today's arrival in Ukraine ofVladimir Lukin, the so-called representative of the Russian President whose mission is, as he says, to contribute to the liberation of the hostages taken in eastern Ukraine.",premise
"due to the particularly dangerous situation in Sloviansk, in accordance with our 2003 law on combating terrorism, Ukraine's National Security and Defence Council has taken the decision to launch a large-scale counter-terrorism operation.",claim
"Owing to increasing threats to the civilian population, this morning the active phase of that counter-terrorism operation was renewed in the area of the cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk, where units of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the National Guard and the Ukrainian Border Service were engaged.",claim
The counter-terrorist operation is being implemented exclusively by the law-enforcement agencies of Ukraine.,claim
nine terrorist checkpoints have been taken under the control of Ukrainian law-enforcement agencies in Sloviansk.,claim
"The illegal militants, many of whom are foreign mercenaries, are using heavy firearms against the Ukrainian special forces.",premise
"They have shot down two Ukrainian helicopters with rocket-propelled grenades, man-portable air defence system guided missiles and anti-aircraft guns.",premise
Two officers have been killed and seven wounded.,premise
The terrorists do not hesitate to use members of the local peaceful population as human shields.,premise
"The brutal tactic of firing from residential buildings is used widely in Sloviansk by the terrorists, who are very well aware of the Government instructions to its law-enforcement agents not to answer fire coming from residential buildings.",premise
"there were also attempts to break through the State border by groups of armed Russian saboteurs, who were stopped by our guards.",premise
we call on our Russian partners to immediately stop supporting all the illegal militants on Ukraine's territory and other actions aimed at undermining the sovereignty and territorial integrity of my country.,claim
Ukraine demands that terrorist saboteurs and all those who have taken up arms in our country lay down their weapons and surrender their hostages and occupied administrative buildings.,claim
"Ukraine, he said, would secure peace and stability in spite of all the efforts to organize acts provocation and unrest aimed at destabilizing the situation in the east and and south of the country, particularly in Kharkiv and Odessa.",claim
he would also like to appeal to the leadership of the Russian Federation to end the hysteria about the events taking place in Ukraine and to cease its threats and intimidation.,claim
If it is concerned about violations of citizens' rights,premise
it should protect them in its own country,claim
where human rights are systematically violated.,premise
"He also called on Russia to end its acts of provocation against Ukraine and to refrain from using terrorism, sabotage and military threats as a form of pressure on it.",claim
Despite all the problems and opposition,premise
peace would be ensured in Ukraine,claim
the terrorist threat in eastern Ukraine would be stopped.,claim
"the twenty-first century has presented humankind and international relations with the gift of practices such as enforced regime change, done in an attempt to impose someone's geopolitical vision on other countries of the world.",premise
It is very clear that every such attempt launched early in the twenty-first century has resulted in terrible destabilization.,premise
"having taken that first step, the people who made those attempts have nonetheless been unable to stop and have gone on with them.",claim
This time that has led to serious destabilization in Ukraine.,claim
"Russia has wanted only one thing, which is to avoid destabilization in Ukraine and settle everything through negotiations.",claim
"We proposed tripartite talks among Ukraine, the European Union and Russia at the start ofthe crisis on the political confrontation that focused on whether Ukraine should sign an association agreement with the European Union.",premise
"When the 25 February agreement was reached, we supported it.",premise
many of the 25 February positions are right,claim
they must be kept to if we hope to bring Ukraine out of political crisis.,claim
We helped to conclude the 17 April Geneva agreement.,premise
it points to a way out of the crisis in the country.,claim
But the most striking and infuriating thing is that the demands of the people of eastern Ukraine are basically fairly simple.,premise
"Finding themselves in a situation in which the nation's capital was occupied by an illegitimate authority, to a large degree consisting of hostile nationalist radical elements, the people asked that their rights be guaranteed.",premise
They demanded federalization.,claim
no one there took up arms for at least a couple of months.,claim
They were all waiting for some constructive reaction from Kyiv to their demands for protecting their own interests.,premise
Not once did any kind of reasonable reaction or serious initiative emanate from Kyiv.,claim
"for which presidential elections are scheduled, and that there will be some kind of poll on decentralization of the country.",premise
"The people have been fighting on the barricades for weeks, and they think they have to conduct a poll in order to figure out people's opinion about what they want.",claim
What bothered me more than anything today was how calmly and approvingly our Western colleagues spoke about the search operations that the Kyiv authorities are now carrying out in eastern Ukraine.,premise
"They gave the impression that they know what the Kyiv authorities are thinking, what their plans are.",premise
"Maybe they had a part in drawing up those plans, and that was why they talked about what was going on so calmly.",premise
"every visit to Kyiv by senior American officials has resulted in events reaching new levels of confrontation, and a more violent turn of events.",claim
"it is not surprising that the United States, as I said in my statement, did not want the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to do as it was supposed to under the Vienna Document, that is, to bring about dialogue and organize a round table with representative of different regions and the Kyiv Government.",claim
Why did the United States not want the OSCE to do that?,premise
"Throughout the crisis, Russia several times has suggested different formats for the organization of such dialogue between the Government and opposition forces and regions.",claim
The Government did not want to or could not do it themselves.,premise
We suggested a constitutional assembly be convened.,premise
They said they were not ready to do so.,premise
"When the meeting of 17 April was organized, we suggested that representatives of the regions should be included, and that the four parties - the European Union, the United States and Russia and the acting Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine - could start those talks.",premise
But that proposal was rejected.,premise
"The OSCE was then given the mandate, which it tried to carry out only then to be told it should not.",premise
"Instead, tanks were brought out to Sloviansk and other cities in the east of the country.",premise
"Regarding what one colleague said, that Russia is refusing to implement the 17 April Geneva statement",premise
"I would repeat that Russia would never refuse to implement any useful document agreed upon during the crisis, including the 21 February agreement.",claim
"then perhaps we might ask the President, the Permanent Representative of Korea, to make a statement following this meeting, stating that the Security Council, in keeping with the 17 April Geneva statement, calls for a swift halt to the violence, including, of course, the use of force in eastern Ukraine, and appeals for the swift and comprehensive implementation of the Geneva statement.",claim
"If other members would be ready to support such action, then we would too.",claim
"First, for the Russians to blame Ukraine for Ukraine's actions in defence of its own people on its own territory really is starting to remind me of the story of the schoolboy who returned home with his nose bloody and his shirt torn and, asked by his mother how the fight started, he said ""it started when the other boy hit me back"".",premise
We have to be clear about cause and effect here,claim
"many Council members, including me, have already gone through the facts that have brought us to this point.",premise
"My second point is to debunk yet another of the lies that have been told in this Chamber, because it relates to my country, the United States.",premise
the United States and other countries never called oon protesters in the Maidan to leave buildings or avoid violence.,claim
we are holding Russian separatists to a different standard.,claim
"On 15 January, we condemned the actions of rioters outside a Kyiv court building on 10 January.",premise
"On 22 January, the aggressive actions of members of the extreme-right group Pravy Sektor were unacceptable, enflaming conditions on the streets and undermining the efforts of peaceful protesters.",premise
We condemned the targeted attacks against journalists and unofficial groups such as Titushky.,premise
"On 24 January, when protesters occupied some regional administration buildings, we reiterated our call for all protesters and Government forces to refrain from violence and the destruction of property.",premise
"On 27 January, we made clear that we condemned the use of violence to seize Government buildings, such as the takeover of a Ministry of Justice building that took place over the past cople of days and of a public exhibition hall that weekend",premise
continued to reiterate our call for all protesters and Government forces to refrain from violence and the destruction of property.,premise
"if we could just take that particular lie of the table, it would be helpful and a little more constructive.",claim
We have a golden opportunity on 25 May for the people of eastern Ukraine to have their voices heard,claim
for them to choose their own leaders and for us to get to a universally legitimate Government that is respected and chosen by all of the people of Ukraine.,premise
Yet Russia will not come out in support of the elections and work with us to ensure that they take place,claim
"which would be the best way of ensuring rights, representativeness and greater autonomy for the people of eastern Ukraine.",premise
"What we have heard from Washington, DC, and the way it was heard clearly demonstrated to all - including to those in Kyiv, which is most important",premise
"the United States looked favourably on the forceful change of power, which did not ultimately serve the interests of the Ukrainian people.",claim
"1 do think it would be good to conclude this meeting with such a statement, not asking every delegation what it is going to declare but rather make ajoint statement calling for a swift halt to all violence. including the use of military force in the cast of the country, and for seriously taking up the full implementation of the Geneva document.",claim
"Malaysia Airlines passenger flight MH-l7 appears to have been shot down over eastern Ukraine, killing all passengers and crew.",premise
The senseless violence unleashed by armed separatists in eastern Ukraine has reached monstrous proportions.,claim
The precise circumstances and causes of this tragic event must be established quickly and beyond any doubt.,claim
"that will require a full, thorough and independent international investigation, in accordance with international civil aviation guidelines.",premise
"The International Civil Aviation Organization, which provides the international legal framework for the investigation of air accidents",premise
should have a central role to play in ensuring that there is credible and independent international involvement.,claim
We welcome the indications from the Ukrainian authorities that they want international investigators to join their efforts.,claim
The immediate priority has to be for investigators to gain access to the crash site so they can start their work.,claim
They must be able to operate unhindered and in security.,claim
There must be no interference or tampering with the evidence.,premise
Armed separatist groups in the vicinity must allow such access.,premise
"Despite assurances made yesterday evening, we understand that has not yet happened.",premise
We call on Russia to use its influence with those groups to ensure that it happens.,claim
Russian officials have claimed that armed separatists in eastern Ukraine represent a spontaneous local insurgency.,premise
We know that is not the case.,premise
We know that the three leading figures of the so-called Donetsk People's Republic are Russian citizens who have come from outside Ukraine.,premise
"We know that weapons, equipment and logistical support have been systematically provided to armed separatist groups by Russia, including up to 100 man-portable air defence systems and 15 to 25 main battle tanks, not to mention artillery pieces, rocket launchers and other armoured vehicles.",premise
The United Kingdom urges Russia to reflect carefully on the situation it has created.,claim
We urge Russia to cease its policy of supporting armed separatist groups and their violent actions of destabilizing a neighbouring country and of generating displacement and social and economic hardship.,claim
These armed groups do not represent the people of Ukraine,claim
"without Russian support, they would wither.",premise
It is the Council's responsibility to respond to such tragedies by drawing the right lessons and working together with commitment and conviction to prevent their repetition.,claim
It is clear where responsibility lies,claim
"with the senseless violence of armed separatists and with those who have supported, equipped and advised them.",claim
"The Council must be united in condemning these actions and in demanding that these groups disarm, desist from violence and intimidation and engage in dialogue through the democratic mechanisms that are available to them.",claim
the members of the Security Council expressed their condolences and called for an international investigation and appropriate accountability.,premise
"That is welcome, but it is not enough.",claim
The Council must go further.,claim
"It should come together behind a clear demand that the armed separatist groups should lay down their arms and pursue whatever political legitimate objectives they may have through exclusively peaceful and democratic means, and that the flow of arms, fighters and logistical support to the armed separatists be fully halted and the borders secured.",claim
any other course of action would be unconscionable.,claim
All 298 people aboard - 283 passangers and 15 crew members - were killed.,premise
"As we stared at the passanger list yesterday, we saw next to three of the passangers' names a capital ""I"".",premise
"As we now know, that letter stands for ""infant"".",premise
We can only commit to them that we will not rest until we find out what happened.,claim
"A full, credible and unimpeded international investigation must begin immediately.",claim
The perpetrators must be brought to justice,claim
they must not be sheltered by any State Member of the United Nations.,claim
"The airliner was travelling at a cruise altitude of 33,000 feet, and its speed was typical for an airliner along an established flight corridor frequented by commercial traffic.",premise
"The flight was transmiting its assigned transponder code, corresponding with its flight plan, and flight tracking data was publicly available on the Internet.",premise
There was nothing threatening or provocative about MH-17.,claim
"Of the operational SAM. systems located near the border, only the SA-Il, SA-20 and SA-22 systems are capable of hitting an aircraft at the flight's altitude of 33,000 feet.",premise
"We can rule out shorter-range SAMSs known to be in separatist hands, including man-portable air defence systems, and SA-8 and SA-13 systems, which are not capable of hitting an aircraft at that altitude.",claim
"Early Thursday, an SA-ll SAM. system was reported near Zahnitkiv by a western reporter, and separatists were spotted hours before the incident with an SA-Il system at a location close to the site where the plane went down.",premise
"Separatists initially claimed responsibility for shooting down a military transport plane, and posted videos that are now being connected to the Malaysia Airlines crash.",premise
"Separatist leaders also boasted on social media about shooting down a plane, but later deleted those messages.",premise
"Because of the technical complexity of the SA-11, it is unlikely that the separatists could effectively operate the system without assistance from knowledgeable personnel.",premise
"Therefore, we cannot rule out technical assistance from Russian personnel in operating the systems.",claim
"The Ukrainians do have SA-ll systems in their inventory; however, we are not aware of any Ukrainian SAM. systems in the area of the shoot-down.",premise
"More important, since the beginning of the crisis Ukrainian air defences have not fired a single missile, despite several alleged violations of their airspace by Russian aircraft.",premise
This also follows a pattern of actions by Russian-backed separatists.,claim
"On 13 June, separatists shot down a Ukrainian transport plane carrying 40 paratroopers and 9 crew members.",premise
"On 24 June, as the Council was meeting to welcome Ukraine's unilateral ceasefire (see S/PV.7205), we received word that separatists had downed a Ukrainian helicopter, killing all nine aboard.",premise
"On 14 July, separatists claimed credit for downing a Ukrainian military cargo plane flying at 6,000 metres.",premise
And on 16 July they claimed credit for the downing of a Ukrainian fighter jet.,premise
"If indeed Russian-backed separatists were behind this attack on a civilian airliner, they and their backers would have good reason to cover up evidence of their crime.",premise
It is therefore extremely important that an investigation be commenced immediately.,claim
"In the first instance, the special monitoring mission the of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe should act as a first responder, thereby laying the foundation for efforts by other international organizations and individual nations, including those whose citizens were victims of the tragedy.",claim
"International investigators must be granted immediate, full and unfettered access to the crash site.",claim
"All those concerned - Russia, pro-Russian separatists and Ukraine - should agree to support an immediate ceasefire to facilitate access by international investigators.",claim
All evidence must remain undisturbed and any evidence removed from the site by the Russian-backed separatists operating in the area should be promptly returned and handed over,claim
Russia needs to help make that happen,claim
"separatist forces backed by the Russian Government continue to destabilize Ukraine and undermine the efforts of Ukraine's elected leaders to build a democratic Ukraine that is stable, unified, secure and able to determine its own future.",claim
"Russia says that it seeks peace in Ukraine, but we have repeatedly provided the Council with evidence of Russia's continued support to the separatists.",premise
"Time after time, President Putin has committed to working towards dialogue and peace - in Geneva in April, in Normandy in June and in Berlin earlier this month - and every single time he has broken that commitment.",claim
"In the past few weeks, Russia has increased the number of tanks, armoured vehicles and rocket launchers in south-west Russia.",premise
More advanced air defence systems have also arrived.,premise
"Moscow recently transferred Soviet- era tanks and artillery to the separatists, and several military vehicles crossed the border.",premise
"After recapturing several Ukrainian cities last weekend, Ukrainian officials discovered caches of weapons long associated with Russian stockpiles, including MANPADs, mines, grenades, meals ready to eat, vehicles and a pontoon bridge.",premise
"Ukrainian forces have discovered large amounts of other Russian-provided military equipment, including accompanying documentation verifying Russian origin, in the areas they have liberated from separatists in recent days.",premise
"Recruiting efforts for separatist fighters are expanding inside Russia, and separatists have openly said that they were looking for volunteers with experience in operating heavy weapons such as tanks and air defences.",premise
Russia has allowed officials from the Donetsk People's Republic to establish a recruiting office in Moscow.,premise
"Ukrainian pilot Nadia Savchenko, who has long had a distinguished career in the Ukrainian military, was taken by separatists in mid-June.",premise
She is now being held - where?,premise
"- in a prison in Voronezh, Russia.",premise
"According to the Ukrainian Government, she was transferred to Russia by separatists.",premise
Russia continues to redeploy new forces extremely close to the Ukrainian border.,premise
"on Monday, a Ukrainian air force cargo plane was shot down in Ukrainian air space, and on Wednesday a Ukrainian fighter jet was also shot down in Ukrainian air space.",premise
"In both instances, the Ukrainian Government believes that the planes were fired on from Russian territory.",premise
It is because of such continued destabilizing Russian actions,premise
"the United States imposed sanctions on the defence, energy and financial sectors of the Russian economy, including financial institutions.",claim
The measures include freezing the assets ofRussian defence companies and blocking new financing of some of Russia's most important banks and energy companies.,premise
The sanctions are significant,claim
but they are also targeted and designed to have the maximum impact on the Russian calculus while limiting the impact on the Russian people and any spillover effects on our interests or those of our allies.,premise
"if President Putin continues to choose escalation over de-escalation, the international community will continue to impose costs on Russia.",claim
But that is not what any of us want.,premise
We and our allies remain committed to a diplomatic solution,claim
"as are the Ukrainian Government and the Ukrainian people, who have seen their neighbours, friends and family members killed in a needless conflict.",premise
President Poroshenko has consistently backed up his words with actions.,claim
"He proposed a comprehensive peace plan and declared a unilateral ceasefire, both of which were cynically rejected by the illegal armed groups and their backers in Moscow.",premise
President Poroshenko's plan offered amnesty to separatists who voluntarily laid down their arms and who are not guilty of capital crimes.,premise
He committed to providing a safe corridor for Russian fighters to return to Russia.,premise
"He established a job-creation programme for the affected areas, made an offer of broad decentralization and dialogue with eastern regions, including the promise of early local elections, and granted increased local control over language, holidays and customs.",premise
President Poroshenko has also reached out to the regions of eastern Ukraine and is pursuing constitutional reforms that will give local regions more authority to choose their regional leaders and protect locally spoken languages.,premise
"He has said that he will meet with separatists in any safe location, inside or outside Ukraine.",premise
"The goal of the United States throughout the crisis in Ukraine has been consistent, namely, to support a stable, peaceful and democratic Ukraine.",premise
We will not be satisfied with a temporary halt to violence.,claim
Russia must stop destabilizing Ukraine and allow all the people of Ukraine to decide their country's future through a democratic political process,claim
"As we sit here, the remains of nearly 300 people - innocent infants, children, women and men - are strewn across a blackened, smouldering landscape in Ukraine.",premise
The victims came from at least nine different nations; they could just as easily have come from any of ours.,premise
We must treat all of them as our own victims.,claim
"We have a duty to each and every one of those individuals, their families and their countries to determine why that jet fell out of the sky and to hold the perpetrators accountable.",claim
We must stop at nothing to bring those responsible to justice.,claim
"This appalling attack occurred in the context of a crisis that has been fuelled by Russian support for separatists through arms, weapons and training, by the Russian failure to follow through on its commitments and by its failure to adhere to the fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter.",claim
"Russia immediately take concrete steps to de-escalate the situation in Ukraine, support a sustainable ceasefire and follow the path towards peace that the Ukrainian Government has consistently offered.",claim
This war can be ended.,claim
Russia can end this war.,claim
Russia must end this war.,claim
"The circumstances ofthe downing mustbe established by an independent, international investigaton, in accordance with international civil aviation guidelines.",claim
The perpetrators cannot escape responsibility.,claim
Investigators must immediately be granted access to the crash site,claim
the black boxes must be handed over to independent authorities in order to prevent the evidence being tampered with.,claim
this horrible crime was committed as part of the armed aggression against Ukraine.,claim
The responsibility for that terror act lies with those who are aggressively preventing Ukraine from effectively exercising its sovereign rights over its territory and airspace.,premise
It would not have happened had Russia not armed and instigated the presence of separatist groups in Donetsk and Luhansk provinces.,premise
The international community cannot stand by in the face of such aggression.,claim
The country has become a threat to international peace and security,claim
We have said that all along since the occupation of Crimea.,premise
The debris of the Malaysian plane lies in an area controlled by pro-Russian separatists.,premise
"This week alone, a Ukrainian AN-26 cargo plane and an Su-25 fighter jet were shot down by pro-Russian separatists from a high altitude.",premise
The third - a Malaysian passenger plane - was deliberately shot down.,premise
An Il-76 transport plane and half a dozen helicopters were brought down by pro-Russian separatists at Luhansk airport and elsewhere.,premise
"In June, separatists boasted of possessing an SA-11 Buk missile system.",premise
They claimed to have used the system to shoot down the An-26 cargo plane at high altitude.,premise
Separatist commander Igor Strelkov claimed to the media to have shot down another aircraft at the same time as the Malaysian Airlines flight was overflying the area.,premise
We are truly shocked by the number of victims among the civilian population in eastern Ukraine.,premise
"Armed separatists, terrorists and foreign fighters and their supporters bear the responsibility for the deaths and injuries among the civilian population, including children, women and the elderly.",claim
The carnage must end.,claim
President Poroshenko proposed a peace plan.,premise
Ukraine declared a unilateral ceasefire.,premise
The agreement in Berlin on 2 July provided a vehicle for talks.,premise
"Yet separatists and terrorists in the eastern part of Ukraine continued to sow terror, loot, rob banks, racketeer, kidnap people and traffic in human beings.",claim
The massive and continuous influx of foreign fighters from across the Russian border into the neighbouring Luhansk and Donetsk regions has gone unabated.,premise
"That influx has been accompanied by T-65 tanks, Grad multiple rocket launchers, anti-aircraft guns, towed anti-tank guns, BTR armoured personnel carriers, man-portable air defence systems and small arms.",premise
"In fact, the terrorists in Donbas hardly bothered to remove the markings of Russian military units from their heavy weapons.",claim
"Russian military helicopters and drones violate Ukrainian airspace, while 40,000 troops are encamped within minutes of the Ukrainian border, in addition to the 20,000 troops stationed in occupied Crimea.",premise
"Russian citizens, many of whom are veterans of the conflicts in Chechnya and Transdnistria, lead many of the terrorist groups.",premise
The Russian media channels are putting out ongoing anti-Ukrainian propaganda.,claim
"The mouthpiece of the separatists, Life News, boasts of the agility of rebels to shoot down any plane in sight.",premise
The terrorists and separatists continue to take hostages.,claim
The abducted and hooded Ukrainian pilot Nadia Savchenko was trafficked by separatists from Ukraine straight to the Russian Voronezh pretrial detention centre.,premise
We condemn the unlawful detention of Ukrainian citizens in Russia.,claim
Russia must respect the norms of international law and release Savchenko immediately.,claim
We remain appalled by the deteriorating human rights situation in Crimea.,claim
"Lithuania urges the holding of a full, thorough and independent investigation into the downing of the Malaysian Airlines flight, as agreed today by the Council.",claim
"Lithuania urges Russia to unequivocally distance itself from any kind of direct or indirect support for terrorists, separatists and foreign fighters.",claim
The insurgents must lay down their weapons.,claim
Lithuania calls on Russia to cooperate with Ukraine in order to ensure the security of the borders and to prevent weapons and armed terrorists from entering the territory of Ukraine.,claim
We call on Russia to constructively cooperate on the implementation of the peace plan put forward by President Petro Poroshenko.,claim
A diplomatic solution is possible.,claim
"Ukraine's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders, including Crimea, are non-negotiable and must be respected by all.",claim
China is shocked and grieved by the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 in eastern Ukraine.,premise
"On behalf of the Chinese Government and people, I express our sincere condolences and deep sympathy to the victims and their families.",premise
The safety of international civil aviation must be guaranteed.,claim
Our priority now is to establish the facts.,premise
"Pending that, it is not advisable to jump to any conclusion, make any assumptions or trade accusations.",premise
"We support the holding of an independent, fair and objective investigation into the incident.",claim
We also call on all parties to coordinate and cooperate during the investigation.,claim
"Armed conflict and incidents of violence frequently occur, causing loss of life and destruction of property.",premise
The crisis in Ukraine is rooted in a complex situation that is both historical and contemporary.,premise
A political solution is the only way out.,claim
We urge the parties concerned to effectively implement the agreed ceasefire and to strengthen dialogue and consultation on the basis of the Geneva agreement in pursuit of a political solution and the prompt achievement of stability and development in Ukraine.,claim
"China respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries, including Ukraine.",claim
China will continue to adopt a fair and objective approach and actively participate in any proposal or initiative that will reduce tension and promote a political solution.,claim
There is mounting evidence that the crash was caused by a missile strike and that the aeroplane was brought down over territory not controlled by the Ukrainian authorities.,premise
"There is increasing credible information that that was conducted by separatist militia groups, acting with the assistance of others.",premise
We owe it to the victims of this tragedy and their families to unequivocally establish the facts behind the incident and to find out exactly what happened and who is responsible.,claim
"If, as appears increasingly likely, Flight MH-17 was brought down by a missile",premise
"that is, as Australia's Prime Minister Tony Abbott has said, ""an unspeakable crime""",claim
the perpetrators must be brought swiftly to justice,claim
"There must be a full, thorough and impartial international investigation.",claim
Feltman's information that ICAO and the Government of Ukraine are communicating on the issue of an investigation.,claim
"There must be immediate preservation of the crash site, and unfettered access for independent investigators.",claim
Safe access must also be provided to allow fro the recovery of the bodies of those who lost their lives in the tragedy.,claim
Undertakings brokered by the trilateral contact group with armed separatists who control the territory in which the crash occurred to allow access must be upheld.,claim
Our Prime Minister has made it clear that Russia's full cooperation with all investigations is expected.,claim
"The Council has just issued a press statement calling for investigation, accountability and immediate access to the crash site.",premise
"Australia believes, given the gravity of the incident, that it is not a sufficient indication of the Council's resolve.",claim
"the Council should adopt a draft resolution that emphasizes the need for access to be granted to the crash site and for a full, thorough, independent and international investigation to be carried out.",claim
This is the nineteenth time that the Council has met to discuss the situation in Ukraine since the crisis began,premise
"Time and time again, the overwhelming majority of the Security Council has called for a end to the violence and destablization.",premise
"Council members have consistently called for a de-escalation of tensions, for separatists to lay down their weapons and for genuine dialogue to commence.",premise
It is time for the equivocation and dissembling and false narratives of some to stop.,claim
"In the three weeks since the Council last discussed the situation in Ukraine (see S/PV.7205), the security situation in the east has become increasingly dire.",premise
"Separatists have ignored repeated calls to disarm and have continued their attacks on Ukrainian military forces, facilities and border posts.",premise
Two Ukrainian military cargo planes were downed in eastern Ukraine in the past week alone.,premise
The Ukrainian armed forces have responded firmly to those attacks.,premise
They has every right to restore law and order,claim
they have underlined their commitment to do so in proportionate manner,claim
Russia has a crucial role to play in de-escalating this persistently dangerous crisis.,claim
It must end its provocations and any support for separatist forces.,claim
"It must control its border with Ukraine and prevent the flow of weapons, equipment and fighters from Russia into Ukraine.",claim
Russia must withdraw the large number of troops it has again amassed on the Ukrainian border.,claim
It must actively work to de-escalate tensions and use its considerable influence with separatist groups in Ukraine to that end.,claim
Further political efforts are essential.,claim
The four-party talks in Berlin in the past two weeks showed some promise.,premise
"The parties agreed on the need for a sustainable ceasefire, the resumption of the contact group, control of border crossing points monitored by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and an extension of the work of the OSCE observer mission to include border monitoring activities.",premise
But we have yet to see results,premise
those efforts must be redoubled,claim
We thought that the situation in Ukraine had already caused too much tragedy.,premise
The horrific loss of Flight MH-17 has added immeasurably to that toll.,premise
It is time for the international community to stand as one to ensure that those responsible for that tragic crime are held to account and to make every effort to bring to an end the violence and destabilization in Ukraine.,claim
The international community owes it to the victims to shed light on the circumstances that led to this tragic event.,premise
A transparent and independent comprehensive international investigation must be completed as soon as possible.,claim
"Safe and unhindered access must be granted to international investigators, as well as to observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and representatives of affected countries.",claim
All parties involved should fully cooperate to that end.,claim
We commend the Ukrainian authorities in that regard.,claim
Those who committed this heinous act must be held accountable.,claim
This air disaster took place in a context of the ongoing deterioration of the situation in the east of Ukraine.,premise
"Day after day, we receive reports of civilians killed in fighting between the Ukrainian armed forces and illegal armed groups.",premise
"The pro-Russian separatist militias continue to occupy buildings and border posts, hold dozens of innocent people hostage and threaten the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine.",premise
The living conditions ofpeople living in areas affected by the hostilities continue to deteriorate,premise
the number of internally displaced persons has steadily increased.,premise
"The escalation of violence in recent days, until its tragic climax yesterday, demonstrates once again that active armed groups in eastern Ukraine are actually well-equipped and well-trained paramilitary forces who enjoy clear external support.",premise
"We urge the Russian Federation to actively use its influence on the illegal armed groups and ensure that weapons and fighters can no longer cross the border, in order to bring about a de-escalation as soon as possible.",claim
Ukraine has demonstrated its commitment to finding a peaceful solution to the crisis and to implementing the agreements concluded,claim
"in particular the joint declaration adopted on 17 April in Geneva between Ukraine, Russia, the European Union and the United States.",premise
Ukraine has established a national dialogue and guarantees for national minorities.,premise
"Once elected, President Poroshenko put forward a comprehensive peace plan and put in place a unilateral ceasefire to create the conditions necessary for its implementation.",premise
"Unfortunately, illegal armed groups, whose sole aim is to destabilize Ukraine, chose not to take that outstretched hand.",claim
Diplomatic efforts to find a peaceful solution to the crisis in eastern Ukraine must continue.,claim
the personal commitment of the Secretary-General since the beginning of the crisis is essential and must continue.,claim
"It is important to urgently reach an agreement on a real and lasting ceasefire that is observed by all parties, so as to create the conditions necessary for the implementation of President Poroshenko's peace plan.",claim
"We welcome the efforts made in that regard by France, Germany and the OSCE to promote dialogue between Russia and Ukraine.",claim
Yesterday's plane crash demonstrated the incalculable consequences that the crisis can have.,premise
"It is high time for all stakeholders, including the Russian Federation, to mobilize all energies to put an end to this crisis.",claim
Given this tragedy and the already chaotic situation,premise
France requests that all efforts be brought forth to shed light on the circumstances that led to the tragedy.,claim
We call for an independent international inquiry that would allow the facts to be established and to draw the necessary conclusions,claim
We ask that all measures be taken to facilitate the work of the investigators on the ground.,claim
"we expect the separatists to cooperate with the Ukrainian authorities in the investigation and to allow safe, immediate and full access to the investigators, in accordance with the decision made yesterday during the video tele-conference between the contact group involving Ukraine, Russia and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the separatist representatives.",premise
A glimmer of hope had begun to dawn in Ukraine at the end of last month.,claim
a process of political normalization had begun.,premise
"A unilateral ceasefire, declared by Kiev on 20 June, hinted at a possible end to the general deteriorating security and humanitarian situation in the east.",premise
President Poroshenko initiated a comprehensive peace plan in order to arrive at a peaceful resolution of the situation.,premise
"following their meeting on the sidelines of the ceremonies marking the Normandy landing, a process of almost daily exchanges between Presidents Poroshenko and Putin and Chancellor Merkel and President Hollande led to the start of a useful dialogue.",premise
"a joint statement was adopted in Berlin on 2 July that provided for the quest of a lasting ceasefire via the meeting between the contact group and the separatists, strengthened border control on the Russian-Ukrainian border to curb the flow of weapons and fighters, and the agreement of the OSCE to participate in that effort.",premise
today the situation continues to deteriorate.,claim
"For several days, fighting has escalated in eastern Ukraine because the separatists have refused to clasp the hand being extended to them.",premise
Every day the attacks are ever more deadly.,claim
Weapons never used until now have begun to be used and have struck Ukrainian territory.,premise
Two Ukrainian planes were shot down in their own airspace.,premise
That could happen only if one of the parties possessed sophisticated anti-aircraft weaponry.,premise
"Moreover, this unprecedented deterioration is also due to the presence of armed fighters coming from outside Ukraine.",premise
"The question of outside support in terms of recruitment, supplies of materials and training cannot be avoided.",claim
The answer is too obvious.,claim
It is irrefutable.,claim
"Weapon systems with significant firepower are being used, which can lead to tragic blunders",premise
Those who are responsible for arming those who use those weapons bear the responsibility for this conflagration.,claim
when bandits are given weapons we cannot be surprised that they behave like bandits.,claim
All those events point to the pressing need for full cooperation by the international community in order to stabilize Ukraine and ensure its sovereignty and territorial integrity.,claim
"We also call for a sincere commitment from Russia, one that so far has been lacking.",claim
"The day before yesterday, the Heads of State and Government of the European Union acknowledged that the many appeals made to Moscow to end its non-cooperative stance had not been heard.",premise
That is the reason for the European Union's decision to impose tougher sanctions.,claim
"However, the strengthening of those sanctions has one and the same goal: to facilitate the emergence of a political solution.",premise
"Our priority remains, first, to end the escalation and establish a lasting ceasefire that is respected by all parties.",premise
we call on Russia to engage constructively in that endeavour and to bring its influence to bear on the illegal armed groups to lay down their arms and engage in dialogue.,claim
Separatist activity must end.,claim
"In order to slow down the flow of weapons and fighters that cross through the Russian-Ukrainian border on a daily basis,",premise
"we call for negotiations between Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE in order to allow the rapid deployment of a monitoring mission at the border.",claim
Let this tragedy at least serve as a warning to all the parties.,premise
"Once the bullets have been shot, they strike indiscriminately and escape all control.",premise
We have reached such moment.,claim
It should still be possible to avoid the worst.,claim
The severity of this event clearly demands action.,claim
Argentina calls for an impartial international investigation that objectively and unequivocally establishes what happened.,claim
Responsibility and the facts must be determined as soon as possible,claim
"investigators must be granted immediate, unhindered access.",claim
"while there had been encouraging indications that the crisis in Ukraine was entering a phase of waning tension, fears that violent confrontation would continue have not dissipated.",premise
calling once again for the armed groups to cease their violence and demanding that they halt unilateral actions and their violations and trampling of human rights,claim
"which do nothing but deepen the crisis and worsen the situation, especially for the civilian population and for the innocent.",premise
"We reiterate the need to safeguard due respect for Ukraine's conduct of its internal affairs without interference - whether military, political or economic 4 in matters under its jurisdiction.",claim
Argentina seeks to promote full respect by everyone for the principles of international law and human rights law as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.,claim
These are sad and difficult times.,premise
Argentina therefore calls for prudence.,claim
We will not join in using the language of geopolitical disputes.,claim
We will not join in a pointless blame game.,claim
"This is a time for sorrow, reflection and an urgent search for the truth behind the incident to determine those responsible.",claim
"Yesterday at noon, the world watched in horror the downing of the Malaysian jetliner.",premise
What happened yesterday seemed to be an apocalyptic end to the world.,premise
"The spectacle is graphically described, respectively, in chapters 8 and 9 of the Book of Revelation: ""hail and fire mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the Earth"", ""the sun and the air were darkened"".",premise
That was what I saw yesterday.,premise
"No matter our religious beliefs, that scenario may become a self-fulfilling prophesy if States continue to choose to open or support theatres of war and conflict in every corner of the world.",premise
What will happen is that the world will self-annihilate.,premise
Enough is enough.,premise
"The fact that this incident occurred as the plane flew over eastern Ukraine, which, for some time now, has been a zone of conflict, indicates that the accident may be connected, in one way or another, to the conflict.",premise
But this is not the time to play the blame game.,claim
"it will mark a new dimension in the Ukraine crisis, one that represents a grave threat to the safety of international civil aviation.",claim
it is of critical importance for the facts surrounding the crash to be dispassionately well-ascertained.,claim
"we would like to express our full support for an independent international investigation, as called for by the Secretary-General.",claim
Noting that the plane went down in an area under the control of armed rebel groups,premise
we urge that those groups cooperate fully and unconditionally with the investigation into the crash.,claim
"We have no doubt that, without the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and the widespread insecurity and lawlessness engendered by the activities of the rebel groups in the eastern part of the country, this tragic accident would not have occurred.",claim
We want to renew our call for a cessation of hostilities in Ukraine and a return to dialogue and negotiation,claim
An open and impartial investigation of the incident is necessary.,claim
"There must be no pressure placed on the investigation, or attempts to prejudge its outcome through broad statements or unfounded allegations.",claim
we believe it would be proper to establish an international commission under the aegis of International Civil Aviation Organization.,claim
"I am certain that any normal person would, first and foremost, ask the question as to what led a Ukrainian aviation dispatcher to send a passenger flight through an area of military clashes - an area being used to carry out strikes against civilian targets, among others, and where anti-aircraft systems were operating.",premise
ensuring the security of civilian aviation in a State's airspace is that State's responsibility.,claim
The State over whose territory a flight is planned must provide the information necessary to ensure the safety of aviation.,claim
"It would seem that an investigation is necessary not only of the disaster, but also of the extent to which Ukrainian aviation authorities carried out their obligations to exercise the relevant law and did everything necessary to ensure that Kyiv's military campaign prevented disasters.",claim
"They have fully demonstrated that ""restraint"" now.",claim
"There have been indiscriminate air strikes, rocket fire and attacks by artillery tanks in Donetsk and Luhansk.",premise
This punitive operation is becoming increasingly destructive for the civilian population and infrastructure.,premise
"Dozens of civilians have been killed, including children.",premise
"Transport systems, community facilities and medical centres have been destroyed.",premise
"According to data of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), there are more than 4.5 million people in eastern Ukraine in the area of the clashes.",premise
Kyiv has not evacuated civilians from those areas.,premise
people must risk their lives to flee the areas of military clashes by themselves.,claim
"There are many reports of people being intentionally targeted by the Ukrainian armed forces as they flee the war, in particular to seek refuge in Russia.",premise
"To date, Russia has hosted more than 110,000 refugees from eastern Ukraine.",premise
That figure continues to grow daily.,claim
Those facts have been confirmed by UNCHR,premise
six Russian regions have declared a state of emergency.,premise
Artillery and mortar shelling by the Ukrainian armed forces into Russian territory has become a regular occurrence.,claim
The targets include border crossing points and peaceful civilians.,claim
Our citizens have been killed and wounded.,premise
We consider those provocations acts of aggression on the part of Ukraine against Russian citizens and against its sovereign territory.,claim
We place all blame on the Kyiv authorities and call for the Ukrainian side to take decisive measures to prevent such incidents in future.,claim
We have repeatedly issued warnings about the danger of trying to resolve the political crisis in Ukraine by force.,claim
"We called for a mutually respectful and inclusive dialogue among all major political forces, Kyiv and the regions.",claim
"the Kyiv authorities have chosen the wrong the path at every turn, with the support of its Western colleagues.",claim
"I am talking about the United States, of course, which pushed Kyiv to escalate the crisis.",claim
They are trying to lay the blame on Russia for the catastrophe caused by the course chosen.,claim
Kyiv cast aside the agreement of 21 February and the road map proposed by the Chair of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).,premise
"The Geneva statement of 17 April and the Berlin declaration of 2 July were also dismissed, although representatives from the Kyiv Government took part in drafting them.",premise
The widely acclaimed peace plan of President Poroshenko became the pretext for military preparations and the deployment of a large-scale punitive operation.,premise
The Kyiv authorities have chosen to suppress dissent.,claim
"Immediately after the February uprising, Kyiv began to call dissenters ""bandits"" and ""terrorists"", and then ""subhumans"" and ""insects"".",premise
Protesters have been massacred in Mariupol and Odesa.,claim
The number of victims continues to rise and no genuine investigation has been carried out.,claim
Dozens of people who politically opposed Kyiv have disappeared.,claim
The promised reform of the Constitution is being prepared in secret.,claim
It appears that Kyiv would like to enlist the support of European structures and then give it to its lucky people.,claim
"Indeed, according to reports, the redistribution of powers from the President to the Parliament, which was the source of the fighting in Maidan for months, is not actually being planned for.",premise
"They have long been a part okaraine's political life, and have come to the forefront through the protest movements in recent months.",premise
"Involving them in the dialogue would prevent a further escalation of the current serious crisis, but instead Kyiv chose to arrest, beat and threaten them.",claim
international institutions have not risen to the occasion.,claim
The reason lies with our Western partners.,premise
"Much has been said, but nothing has been done to resolve the situation.",premise
We are working hard in the OSCE.,claim
"In the Security Council, the Russian delegation proposed three times the serious drafting of a resolution that would put an end to the violence in Ukraine.",premise
But Western colleagues responded to our proposals with blatant cynicism.,claim
"It seems that whatever the Ukrainian Government arbitrarily does is judged favourably, but the victims of the geopolitical ambitions of the Ukrainian regime are actually an entire nation - the people of Ukraine.",premise
The punitive operation in eastern Ukraine must be stopped immediately.,claim
"Negotiating a resolution to the crisis is still possible, but the right choice must be made.",claim
"A thorough and independent international investigation, involving, among others, the International Civil Aviation Organization, must be conducted immediately.",claim
Whoever is responsible for the tragedy must be held fully accountable.,claim
If this incident turns out to have been caused by a deliberate attack,premise
"the Republic of Korea, itself a former victim of hostilities against a civilian airlines, believes that the international community should do everything in its power to bring the perpetrators to justice as quickly as possible.",claim
"No one should be allowed, for any reason, to get away with killing so many innocent people, who had nothing to do with what is happening on the ground.",claim
"We support the ongoing efforts to bring stability to Ukraine, in particular the efforts of the United Nations, the European Union, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and bilateral partners",claim
"Such efforts, aimed at de-escalating the violence in eastern Ukraine, should continue despite the daunting challenges.",claim
Their lives were cut off in the middle of a crisis on which this very Council has been unable to take action since it began in February.,premise
With the shooting down of a civilian airplane carrying civilians,premise
the Ukrainian crisis is no longer a conflict between the Ukrainian military and armed separatists.,claim
"The conflict has crossed a red line by endangering all our lives, as if did in the case of the men, women and children from different countries who were aboard Flight MH-l7.",premise
"We condemn in the strongest terms this reckless attack and call for a comprehensive, independent, international investigation in accordance with international guidelines, as agreed in the press statement adopted this morning.",claim
Such an investigaton should establish responsibility so that the perpetrators can be held accountable.,claim
"we further urge all parties to cease fire, to fully cooperate with the investigation and to grant unhindered access to the crash site in order to allow international investigators to carry out their work.",claim
We note that yesterday's criminal act follows the downing of a Ukrainian fighter jet on Wednesday and that of a military cargo plane on Monday.,premise
"The frequent use of surface-to-air missiles during the past few months raises the question of access to such weapons, which, as we have now seen, are capable of downing a civilian airplane flying at over 30,000 feet",premise
the Security Council and the broader international community can no longer afford to turn a blind eye on the matter.,claim
"This act undermines valuable initiatives of the trilateral contact group of senior representatives of Ukraine, the Russian Federation and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, who were making all necessary efforts for a resumption of consultations with separatists in eastern Ukraine.",claim
"let me renew our call to the armed groups to respect the unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity okaraine.",claim
They must lay down their weapons and engage in constructive dialogue with the Ukrainian Government.,claim
we urge all parties to immediately cease fire and support the ongoing efforts to de-escalate the crisis and bring peace to Ukraine and the region.,claim
"The shooting down of a civilian plane in the midst of the conflict in eastern Ukraine is a stark reminder of the moral responsibility of Security Council members to set aside their divisions on this crisis, to hold the perpetrators of this criminal act to account and to uphold their mandate to maintain international peace and security.",claim
I would like to start by expressing my Government's sorrow and deep condolences to all the Missions whose citizens were killed in the terrible crash of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17.,premise
"The Ukrainian authorities have already called on international organizations, including the International Civil Aviation Organization, Interpol and others, to undertake a thorough international investigation of the accident.",premise
We believe that an impartial investigation will reveal the truth,claim
all perpetrators will be punished,claim
"Yesterday, the Ukrainian leadership announced a basic version of what happened with the flight",premise
it was an act of terror.,claim
"The position of our Government is based on converging data from different intelligence and open sources, which show that the aircraft was shot down over territory controlled by terrorists.",premise
"Two Ukrainian jets were shot down near the same location several days before, with terrorist leaders claiming responsibility for those acts.",premise
Intercepted telephone conversations between the terrorist leaders and their coordinator - Russian military intelligence colonel Vasili Geranin - confirm that terrorists are behind this crime,premise
"That conversation was recorded, and the Secretariat has promised to convey it to members of the Security Council.",premise
"Immediately after the crash, the military leader of the terrorists, Igor Girkin Strelkov, who is of Russian origin, boasting on social networks, commented on having shot down what he believed to be a Ukrainian jet, saying the following.",premise
"""In Torez, Ukraine, an AN-26 has been shot down.",premise
It is lying somewhere near the Progress coal mine.,premise
"We have warned everyone not to fly in our skies"".",premise
"To target and shoot down an aeroplane at an altitude of as high as 10 kilometres would be possible only by using a sophisticated anti-aircraft system, such as the SA-ll Buk missile system, or a similar system.",premise
"It has been affirmed both by the radio interception of terrorist leaders and by photographs and video-recordings obtained from citizens of cities in the area, that the terrorists have at least two SA-ll Buk missile systems.",premise
"The question is, where did they get those sophisticated anti-defence systems?",premise
"I reiterate that radio interceptions, photographs and the confessions of detained terrorists, including two recently detained Russian citizens who were going to join the terrorists as military experts, state that the Buk system came from Russia.",premise
This tragedy would not have been possible if Russia had not supported the terrorists and if a sophisticated anti-aircraft system had not been provided to them from Russia.,claim
"On many occasions, the Ukrainian Mission to the United Nations has addressed the Security Council and all States Members of the United Nations and has given them information about Russia's support for the terrorists in eastern Ukraine.",premise
"Only yesterday, we presented new evidence to United Nations-accredited media.",premise
"The huge supply of weapons of Russian origin being used by terrorists in Donbas, which has been documented by the Ukrainian intelligence agencies, the media and the general public, is no longer a secret to anyone.",premise
"A large exhibition of confiscated modern weapons, seized by the Ukrainian military forces from terrorist groups, took place in Kyiv a few days ago.",premise
"In most cases, the actual military units of the Russian armed forces are specified as the origin of those weapons.",premise
Russian nationals are directly participating in destabilizing the situation in eastern Ukraine.,claim
Some colleagues have today given some information about the Luhansk and Donetsk leaders proclaiming republics.,premise
All their military commanders are of Russian origin.,premise
Paragraph 2 of article 208 of the criminal code of the Russian Federation states the following.,premise
"""Participation in armed groups that are not governed by federal law, as well as participation in such armed groups on the territory of a foreign State for any purpose against the interests of the Russian Federation, is punishable by 5 to 10 years' imprisonment"".",premise
"Since no Russian national has been brought to justice for such actions, there is only one conclusion",premise
their participation in illegal armed groups on the territory of Ukraine does not contradict the interests of the Russian Federation.,claim
The situation on the Ukrainian-Russian State border has significantly deteriorated in recent days,claim
"systematic violations coming from the Russian side of the border, as well as the provocative actions of armed terrorist groups in the border areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions.",premise
"Several times a day, columns of military vehicles and Russian mercenaries attempt to break through the Ukrainian State border from the Russian side.",premise
Such attempts are actively facilitated by Russian border protection units.,premise
The anti-terrorist forces in Ukraine have been repeatedly shelled from the territory of Russia.,premise
Ukraine has documented evidence of all those facts for the appropriate international response.,premise
The number of provocations on the Ukrainian-Russian State border has increased substantially.,premise
Illegal armed groups systematically fire towards the territory of Russia in order to create the false image of Ukrainian military fire.,premise
That caused the death of a Russian citizen.,premise
"The Russian side accused the armed forces of Ukraine of shelling on Russian territory on 28 June, namely, Mine No. 24 of Vasetskaya village in the Krasnosulynsky district of the Rostov region and the Gukovo border checkpoint.",premise
The Ukrainian armed forces have never attacked or fired on the territory of Russia.,premise
All such provocations are committed by pro-Russian terrorists in order to find grounds for a further escalation.,claim
Russia continues to redeploy new forces extremely close to the Ukrainian border.,claim
"As of 14 July, the total number of groups of Russian armed forces in the areas bordering Ukraine has significantly increased.",premise
"They comprise 33 battalion tactical groups, with a total of at least 40,000 troops directly around Ukraine, including up to 18,000 troops in Transnistria and up to 21,000 troops in the occupied territory ofCrimea.",premise
Those and similar actions constitute a flagrant violation by Russia of its obligations under the Charter of the United Nations and other universally recognized principles and norms of international law.,premise
Those actions are incompatible with the obligations of the Russian Federation under the Geneva agreement of 17 April and the Berlin declaration of2 June.,premise
"Despite all the international efforts, supported by the strong Ukrainian will to prevent a further escalation and further strengthened by the President's peace plan",premise
the foreign terrorists and their Russian supporters have no intention of leaving us in peace or laying down their arms.,claim
We are still struggling against high-capacity military saboteurs who are willing to destroy Ukraine and to establish havens for chaos and instability.,premise
"Ukraine demands that the Russian side immediately cease provocations on the State border of Ukraine, stop hindering the efforts of the Ukrainian side and the international community to put an end to terrorism and other violence in Donetsk and Luhansk regions, return to President Poroshenko's peace plan, withdraw its forces from the Ukrainian border and stop threatening peace and security in our country, the region and the world as a whole.",claim
"According to various sources and reports, the airplane was presumably shot down by a surface-to-air missile.",premise
If that is indeed the case,premise
"such a heinous act is tantamount to a grave violation of international law, in particular international humanitarian law.",claim
"Indonesia calls upon the Security Council to take immediate steps to enable a thorough, transparent and independent international investigation to be conducted upon this horrendous incident.",claim
Indonesia stands ready to join and support such an investigation.,claim
"If the investigation concludes that the crash was indeed intentionally caused by human factors, be it a missile strike or otherwise,",premise
Indonesia demands that the perpetrators of such a heinous and inhuman crime be brought to justice to the fullest extent of the law.,claim
"Belgium launches an appeal to all the parties to guarantee full access to the disaster site, not only for the search and rescue teams but also for the investigators.",claim
"A full, detailed, thorough and impartial international investigation should be conducted to determine the exact circumstances surrounding the MH-17 disaster.",claim
"Belgium supports the proposal of Australia that the Security Council adopt a draft resolution that stresses the need for guaranteed access to the site and for the conduct of a full, independent international investigation.",claim
"We owe it to the victims and their families, as well as to ourselves, to shed full light on what happened yesterday in eastern Ukraine.",premise
"the situation has deteriorated, with further tensions and violence, and we cannot remain indifferent to that. ",claim
We are deeply concerned that the tension and violence may continue and indeed worsen. ,claim
it is essential that we adhere to the principles that we subscribe to as Members of the United Nations. ,claim
"we must remember our commitment to non-interference in the internal affairs of States, whether militarily, politically or economically. ",claim
we believe that the action of any State or international organization must duly respect Ukraine's handling of its own affairs. ,claim
the situation will not be resolved through any kind of unilateral action. ,premise
It is crucial that the use of force be avoided. ,claim
We join the Secretary- General today in calling on all parties to endeavour to bring calm to the situation. ,claim
Maximal self-restraint must be shown ,claim
constructive dialogue sought and established on an urgent basis ,claim
in order to de-escalate the situation and address the parties' differences. ,premise
Argentina will continue to promote dialogue and a peaceful settlement of the crisis. ,claim
It is essential to step up efforts to create the conditions necessary for urgent dialogue to begin ,claim
solutions can be found to the parties' differences and the interests of all minorities are taken into account. ,premise
the international community should concentrate its efforts on establishing dialogue. ,claim
Ukrainians must have a democratic and peaceful outcome to the situation. ,claim
The illegal annexation of Crimea ,premise
the dire human rights situation there and in the east of Ukraine ,premise
Russia's failure to implement its commitments under the Minsk agreements ,premise
the situation continues to present a clear threat to international peace and security. ,claim
"The United Kingdom welcomes theworkoftheUnitedNationsHumanRightsMonitoring Mission in Ukraine, whose objective and impartial reporting cuts through Russia's misinformation and propaganda. ",claim
"Its sixth report lays bare the grim reality of life in separatist-controlled areas in Donetsk and Luhansk, where ""armed groups continued to terrorize the population"" and ""there is a complete breakdown of law and order"". ",premise
"abductions, torture and other serious human rights abuses carry on unchecked, and neither protection nor justice is available to victims. ",claim
The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) is rightly concerned about a lack of accountability. ,claim
"It is essential that independent investigations take place into all serious allegations of violations, whoever the perpetrators are. ",claim
"We are troubled by the Human Rights Watch report this week, which alleges the use of cluster munitions by the Ukrainian army. ",premise
We are aware that Ukraine refutes those allegations and denies that the Ukrainian army uses such munitions. ,premise
We also note that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) has said today that its monitors have seen no evidence of cluster bombs ,premise
we welcome Ukraine's commitment to cooperating with Human Rights Watch and to a further investigation into those claims. ,claim
We are deeply perturbed by the OHCHR report's  account of a deteriorating human rights situation in the illegally annexed Crimean peninsula. ,claim
"The introduction of Russian Federation legislation, in contravention of General Assembly resolution 68/262, has curtailed the freedoms of expression, peaceful assembly, association, religion and belief. ",premise
The treatment of the Crimean Tatar population is particularly troubling. ,claim
"Russia has often claimed to have concerns about the rights of minority populations in Ukraine, but we see no evidence of that concern for the rights of the Tatars in Crimea. ",premise
The humanitarian situation in the areas controlled by the armed separatist groups remain precarious and will become even more serious as winter approaches. ,premise
But the sending of convoys into Ukraine by Russia without the agreement of the Government of Ukraine and in breach of Ukraine's sovereignty is a provocative act and must not be repeated. ,claim
Humanitarian assistance is necessary ,claim
it must be provided in an international effort coordinated by the appropriate agencies and with the agreement of the Government of Ukraine. ,claim
"it should immediately withdraw its remaining military forces from Ukraine, stop its flow of weapons to the separatists and instead help to restore Ukrainian sovereignty and to secure a political solution to the crisis. ",claim
The Minsk agreements offer a real prospect of de-escalating tensions in eastern Ukraine. ,premise
All parties must match words with actions and implement the commitments they have made. ,claim
"The Government of Ukraine has taken important steps, including the approval of a special status for districts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions and an amnesty law which, the OHCHR report notes, meets international human rights standards. ",premise
And the Government is now preparing for local elections to be held under Ukrainian law in separatist-controlled areas of Luhansk and Donetsk. ,premise
"Russia, by contrast, continues to supply separatists with weapons and material, including multiple rocket launchers and artillery ",premise
continues to maintain several hundred of its forces in Ukrainian territory ,premise
"in yet another ominous reminder of the tactics it used to shape the frozen conflicts in Moldova and Georgia, is handing out passports to individuals in separatist-held areas. ",premise
"As the Minsk agreements make clear, in order for the situation in eastern Ukraine to stabilize, ",premise
"it is vital that all illegally armed groups, military equipment, fighters and mercenaries be withdrawn and the Ukrainian-  Russian border secured with increased monitoring under OSCE verification. ",claim
"If Russia is committed to those agreements, then why on Wednesday of this week, in Vienna, did it block the expansion of the OSCE border-monitoring mission? ",premise
That violates article 4 of the Minsk protocol and demonstrates that Russia is seeking to prevent effective monitoring of its border so that it may continue to supply weapons and equipment to militant groups. ,premise
Stability will not be restored if Russia continues to support separatist groups Whose leaders have expressed their intentions to expand the territory under their control. ,claim
This Sunday's parliamentary elections mark Ukraine's commitment to democracy. ,premise
They must be allowed to go ahead without external influence. ,claim
"The Ukrainian authorities are taking steps to ensure that as many Ukrainian citizens as possible can exercise their right to vote, including by putting in place arrangements for people displaced from their homes by the instability in the east and those from the illegally annexed territory of Crimea. ",premise
"Our expectation is that Russia, as a permanent member of the Security Council and as a party to the Minsk agreements, will work to restore peace and security in Ukraine by respecting the outcome of the elections and by supporting the forthcoming local elections held under Ukrainian law. ",claim
"We urge the Russians not to renege on the commitments they have made, but rather to use their influence to prevent the organization of any separate elections by separatists in Donetsk or Luhansk in November. ",claim
Such elections would be illegal ,premise
would contravene the Minsk agreements ,premise
would present a significant obstacle to a lasting peace in Ukraine. ,premise
"The monitoring missions of the United Nations and Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) must be provided with full, free and unrestricted access to the whole territory of Ukraine, including Crimea. ",claim
"a ceasefire has come into effect, or rather a ""fire and cease"", in the interpretation of separatists. ",claim
"Ukrainian forces and civilians have been shelled some 2,000 times ",premise
some 90 Ukrainian servicemen have been killed and 500 have been wounded. ,premise
"The self-proclaimed Premier of the so-called Donetsk People's Republic, Zakharchenko, claims that all of the Donetsk region is theirs, and that they could take the towns of Berdiansk and Izium, among others. ",premise
Russian soldiers continue to die on Ukrainian soil ,premise
soldiers who allegedly are not even there. ,premise
"Yelena Vasilyeva, the head of a Russian women's group, Cargo 200 from Ukraine to Russia, says that some 4,000 Russian soldiers have lost their lives in Ukraine. ",premise
The self-appointed separatist Chieftains in eastern Ukraine - pawns in the Kremlin's dangerous Novorossia plan of redrawing Europe's borders - are wasting no time in causing to erode what was achieved in Minsk. ,claim
Relentless attacks by illegal armed groups on Donetsk airport are a daily reality. ,premise
The latest reports of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission speak of the attempts by separatist armed groups to seize strategic targets. ,premise
"Sophisticated Russian military equipment, multiple rocket launchers, tanks and ammunition continue to cause death and destruction on Ukraine's soil ",premise
the border remains wide open for the comings and goings of men in military fatigues and Cossack uniforms. ,premise
"As a matter of fact, only one kilometre of the entire 400-kilometre segment of the border, currently out of Ukraine's control, is being monitored by the OSCE. ",claim
Russia single-handedly blocked the extension of the OSCE Observer Mission's activities along the entire border. ,premise
"""We control the border and we will not let Ukrainian border guards return there. ",premise
"We do not need any international mediators on the border, either"", says Andrei Purgin, self-proclaimed First Deputy Prime Minister of the Donetsk People's Republic, according to Interfax. ",premise
"that could witness illegal flows of military supplies and foreign fighters or register the fact that Ukraine's coal and equipment are being smuggled out ofthe country, causing Ukraine considerable economic and financial damage? ",claim
"Russia sent three unchecked humanitarian aid convoys into Ukraine in clear breach of Ukraine's sovereignty, without inspection by the Ukrainian authorities and without coordination with the International Committee of the Red Cross. ",premise
"immediately after the entry of those mystery convoys, the rebels were quick to regain ground and reverse Ukraine's successes in clearing the area ofillegal armed groups. ",premise
"the separatists are planning an election of their own on 2 November - another sham, illegal and illegitimate election, another cynical and blatant breach of the Minsk agreements. ",claim
The human rights situation in the areas controlled by Russian-backed armed groups remains of most serious concern. ,claim
"Extrajudicial killings, torture, intimidation, public humiliation, ill-treatment, extortion, abductions for ransom, and forced labour remain the trademarks of the pro-Russian militants in eastern Ukraine ",premise
"As the latest report of the monitoring group indicates, violence against women in separatist-held areas, including rape, has reached disturbing proportions. ",premise
Information on child soldiers among the militant separatists and military schools for children points to violations of international humanitarian law. ,premise
The situation of the indigenous Tatar community in Russia-occupied Crimea continues to deteriorate. ,claim
"Reported cases of kidnapping, torture and killing of young male Crimean Tatars, their persecution and eviction from the Mejlis in Simferopol, and interrogations of the community's activists continue unabated. ",premise
"in spite of the multiple atrocities committed by the illegal separatist groups, we have yet to hear a single condemnation of those crimes by Russia ",premise
"It is quite ironic that Russia, which has consistently ignored Human Rights Watch reports on such abuses ",claim
"While Ukraine has denied their use, its joining the Oslo Convention would be the best antidote to any further speculations to that effect, and we urge Ukraine to do so. ",claim
Ukraine is demonstrating its commitment to implementing the Minsk agreements. ,claim
Life is slowly returning to normal in areas freed from the illegal insurgents. ,premise
"Important legislation has been adopted, as noted by Assistant Secretary-General Simonovie. ",premise
"On 18 October, the law on the special status of Luhansk and Donetsk came into effect. ",premise
We commend Ukraine's commitment to pursuing the path of difficult but necessary reforms and strongly encourage the Government to continue the national dialogue and ensure full inclusion of all components of the population. ,claim
"we must stress that without Russia's full cooperation and compliance, the Minsk agreements will be worth no more than the paper on which they are written ",claim
"The only viable solution is one that fully respects Ukraine's sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity, including Crimea as an integral part of Ukraine. ",claim
"Russia must immediately withdraw all its armed formations, military equipment and fighters from the territory of Ukraine, stop supporting and arming the separatists, and unequivocally condemn the illegal elections planned by the separatist commandos. ",claim
Permanent monitoring and verification on both sides of the Ukrainian-Russian border must be ensured. ,claim
Russia should also stop escalating tensions in the wider region. ,claim
The recently proposed draft agreement on alliance and integration between the Russian Federation and the surrogate republic of Abkhazia is nothing else than a de facto annexation of an integral part of Georgia. ,premise
With thousands of human lives lost and hundreds of thousands displaced ,premise
it is also essential to establish accountability for the human rights violations and abuses that have taken place during the war against Ukraine. ,claim
Those who have committed serious violations of international humanitarian and human rights law must be brought to account. ,claim
we encourage Ukraine to accede to the International Criminal Court Statute and accelerate its national efforts to pursue accountability. ,claim
"We also reiterate our position that those responsible for the downing of Flight MH-l7, as well as those who have obstructed access to its crash site and interfered with the investigation, must be brought to account. ",claim
The United States has always been and remains steadfastly committed to finding a peaceful solution to the crisis in Ukraine. ,claim
"Peace requires respect - respect for international law, respect for borders, respect for other nations' sovereignty. ",claim
It requires living up to one's commitments and owning up to one's actions. ,claim
"Yet, over the course of our 25 meetings in the Security Council on Ukraine, that has proved an overwhelming challenge for Russia. ",claim
"Russia continues to provide separatists with resources, arms and training, all the while continuing to deny it is doing so. ",premise
"Ukrainian pilot Nadiya Savchenko was seized by separatists in Ukraine and somehow ended up unlawfully transferred to Russia, where she is now being forced to undergo what is termed ""psychiatric evaluation"", in which her human rights are violated through the use of a practice made infamous in the Soviet Union. ",premise
"We have seen reports of other Ukrainians similarly detained in Russia, with similar disregard for international standards. ",premise
Those actions must stop. ,claim
There is one clear path to recovering peace in Ukraine. ,premise
"All sides, including Russia and the separatists it supports, must honour the commitments they agreed to on 5 September in Minsk. ",claim
"Those commitments include an immediate end to ceasefire violations, restoration of Ukrainian control of its side of the international border, monitoring of the border by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and a security zone on either side of the border, withdrawal of foreign forces, mercenaries and equipment from Ukraine, and the release of hostages and prisoners. ",premise
the Ukrainians have taken action on all those for which they have a responsibility. ,claim
both the separatists supported by the Russian Federation and Russia itself have failed to implement their Minsk commitments. ,claim
"In response to the Ukrainian laws on special status that provide additional autonomy for parts of Donetsk and Luhansk, including special elections to be held on 7 December, the separatists have declared unilaterally that they would hold their own local so-called elections in November. ",premise
That is unconstitutional and completely inconsistent with the Minsk agreements. ,premise
"It also reveals the separatists' true intentions, which are not to empower people with a choice within the legal political process of Ukraine, but rather to set up another vote that they can once again rig. ",claim
"Continued separatist assaults in locations throughout Donetsk and Luhansk, including in and around the airport, have resulted in the killing and wounding of scores of Ukrainian armed forces and civilians, and the destruction of vital infrastructure. ",premise
Those attacks have occurred since the agreement in Minsk and after the ceasefire went into effect. ,premise
The failure to live up to the ceasefire is only imposing greater hardship and suffering on the people of the Donbas region. ,premise
"They are the ones being forced to live with no water or electricity and no opportunity to earn a living, and their children are the ones whose schools are in the crossfire. ",premise
That is not how anyone should live. ,claim
"The people okaraine will celebrate a milestone on Sunday as they go to the polls to elect a new parliament, demonstrating their commitment to an enduring democratic process, despite the political upheaval during the past year. ",premise
"We hope to see wide participation in the elections by all Ukrainians, including in Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk ",premise
strongly condemn any interference in that legitimate democratic process. ,claim
"Ukraine seeks to build a peaceful, stable and secure future ",claim
Russia continues to occupy Ukraine. ,claim
"Following its attempted annexation of Crimea, Russia's representative pledged that the Council ""has no need to worry about the fate of the Crimean Tatars"" (S/PV. 7157, p. 21). ",premise
"Yet we see report after report documenting abuses, including detentions, expulsions, restrictions of movement and the curtailment of the freedoms of expression, peaceful assembly, association and religion or belief. ",premise
The Russian occupation of Crimea must end ,claim
the Russian occupying authorities must cease their harassment ofreligious and ethnic minorities and allow international human rights monitors and monitors from the OSCE full access to Crimea. ,claim
"In Crimea, we have seen how a group of separatists who seized power on the pretext of protecting one minority have become the cruel oppressors of another. ",premise
We should expect nothing different from the separatists trying to seize control in eastern Ukraine. ,claim
We welcome Ukraine's commitment to investigating the allegations of mass graves ,claim
"in July, with the assistance of international experts, Ukraine began an investigation into grave sites containing eight bodies that were discovered in Sloviansk following the town's liberation from separatist control. ",premise
"No one is above the law, and the United States supports a full, thorough and impartial investigation of all alleged grave sites. ",claim
"Full implementation of the Minsk agreement would, of course, create an environment that would enable those investigations to move forward. ",claim
We are also aware of reporting by non-governmental organizations on the use of cluster munitions. ,premise
We take note of the Ukrainian Government's denial of the use of such weapons. ,claim
We take very seriously all accusations regarding harm to civilians and unequivocally condemn  any indiscriminate shelling of civilian areas. ,claim
"There can be no excuse for abuses committed by anyone fighting in eastern Ukraine, and all such accusations should be fully investigated as soon as the security conditions allow. ",claim
the separatists and their Russian backers must cooperate. ,claim
"in the Minsk agreement of 5 September, point number 4 of the 12 calls for permanent monitoring of the Ukrainian-Russian State border and verification of it by the OSCE. ",premise
"The Government of Ukraine recently submitted a plan to provide for that monitoring, restore Ukrainian control on its side of the border, prevent the illegal movement of personnel and materiel across the border and create a security zone free of weapons in the areas adjacent to the border in Ukraine and the Russian Federation. ",claim
"But Russia has not engaged on this plan, neither have the separatists, and Russia has refused to expand OSCE monitoring along the border. ",claim
"Until a full monitoring mission is in place on the international border, supplies and equipment will continue to flow from Russia to the separatists, and separatists will continue to cross back and forth at will. ",claim
President Putin said in Milan that he would not discuss OSCE monitoring of the border until the residents of the Donbas are secure. ,premise
the reverse is true. ,claim
The residents of Donbas will not be secure until the OSCE is monitoring the border. ,premise
Ukraine's sovereignty must be restored over the entirety of its border with Russia. ,claim
"If the border can be secured and if free and fair elections can be held - not only on 26 October across Ukraine for the Rada, but also on 7 December in the areas of Donetsk and Luhansk ",premise
"everybody will benefit, as will the cause ofpeace and security. ",claim
Russia's actions over the past months have challenged the most basic principles of our international system. ,claim
Borders cannot and should not be redrawn at the barrel of a gun or on the whim of a single leader and the circle of his cronies around him. ,claim
We have identified a path to peace. ,claim
That path has been agreed to by the parties in Minsk. ,claim
"It has concrete, verifiable commitments, and all must be implemented. ",claim
"Ukraine has taken real steps to fulfil its commitments, while Russia and the separatist it backs have not. ",premise
"We call on them to act immediately to implement the obligations they undertook, and we call on them to do so now. ",claim
The human rights situation in Ukraine continues to deteriorate ,claim
as the sixth report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights based on the work of the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine makes clear. ,premise
"It has been marked by an escalation ofhostilities that came to a head at the beginning of September, just before the signing of the ceasefire agreement. ",premise
"The report emphasizes that for the fighting to have reached such a level of intensity, the pro-Russian militias must have been supported by many foreign fighters, including Russians, and must also have been reinforced with sophisticated weaponry. ",premise
Those responsible for the escalation are the same as those who several months ago decided that Ukrainian sovereignty could be violated ,claim
"the front as a whole has stabilized, leading to a diminished overall level of violence ",claim
although the ceasefire is regularly violated and fighting continues here and there owing to the separatists' wish to homogenize their territory ,claim
"The situation this summer led to a significant increase in casualties, both civilian and military, and to an increase in violations of human rights, including recourse to torture, summary executions and abductions. ",premise
"We condemn all violations of international standards, including the protection of human rights that should be respected by all parties to the conflict. ",claim
"That is especially true in the areas controlled by the separatists, in which people are indeed living in fear and under threat and from which thousands of civilians have fled. ",claim
We should remember that the death penalty has been reinstated in Donetsk ,premise
"that when people leave their homes, they are confiscated ",premise
that there are no more police or courts to defend Ukrainians against the arbitrary decisions of militias. ,premise
"thousands of people have taken to the road, forced to leave everything they own. ",premise
With winter approaching ,premise
the displaced populations will be in a seriously precarious situation ,claim
We are also following with concern the deteriorating situation for the people of Crimea. ,claim
"The Tatars, in particular, are experiencing abuse from self-defence groups as well as numerous administrative problems, expropriations and arbitrary arrests. ",premise
"Their human rights, such as the freedoms of expression, religion, conscience and movement, are routinely flouted. ",premise
we wish to reiterate our commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine's international borders. ,claim
"Against that bleak backdrop, a new dynamic has nonetheless emerged. ",claim
"With the ceasefire agreed in Minsk on 5 September, followed by the 19 September agreement, a diplomatic process has finally begun between Kyiv and Moscow. ",premise
"France, together with its European partners, will continue to support that engagement between the Russians and the Ukrainians, in particular within the framework of the format agreed in Normandy in June. ",premise
"Those agreements offer a sound basis for envisioning a solution to the crisis that is based on three pillars: respect for the ceasefire, the monitoring of the border, and political discussions aimed at finding a lasting solution. ",claim
"There has been some progress on border monitoring and the monitoring of the cease-fire, generally speaking. ",claim
"we will remain vigilant to ensure that support for the separatists finally ceases, that the weakening of the State and the rule of law is checked, and that the ceasefire is fully respected. ",claim
We believe the mandate of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission in Russian territory should be strengthened and expanded as quickly as possible to cover other border crossings. ,claim
Those efforts testify to our collective commitment to resolve the crisis in Ukraine. ,claim
But that crisis can only be resolved if all the actors act in equal good faith. ,premise
"We welcome the measures taken by Ukraine to implement its commitments, in particular the adoption by the Ukrainian parliament of a law envisioning an interim status of local autonomy for certain regions. ",premise
we would hope that the establishment of that new status through upcoming local elections might provide an opportunity for all parties to resolutely commit to a de-escalation and to a solution to the crisis. ,claim
"we call on all parties to work effectively to make it possible to hold early parliamentary elections this Sunday, in accordance with international standards and on all of the Ukrainian territory. ",claim
Those elections are crucial to enable Ukraine to continue on its necessary path of reforms. ,premise
Those who oppose the election would be demonstrating their rejection of compromise and peace. ,claim
"The elections on Sunday are an opportunity for a fresh start for Ukraine, for Russia and for stability in the whole region. ",claim
fighting has continued to flare up in Donetsk ,claim
with daily reports of shelling and skirmishes threatening to derail a fragile ceasefire. ,premise
We are especially troubled by the report that more than 300 fatalities have been recorded since the ceasefire came into effect. ,premise
Those ongoing ceasefire violations ,premise
the risk of the re-escalation of tensions still remains ,claim
the slightest provocation could once again cause the situation to spiral further out of control. ,claim
"all concerned parties must take immediate and credible steps towards the observance of a durable ceasefire, including the full implementation of the Minsk ceasefire memorandum. ",claim
Any further incitement or provocative actions aimed at disrupting the peace process must cease immediately. ,claim
we believe that there must be effective control and credible verification of the ceasefire as an integral part of the implementation of the Minsk ceasefire memorandum. ,claim
the safety and security of international personnel under difficult and challenging conditions must be fully guaranteed by all actors on the ground. ,claim
We also take this opportunity to reiterate our full support for the work of the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine. ,claim
"As its recent report elaborated in detail, the protracted fighting in eastern Ukraine has resulted in further deterioration of the human rights and humanitarian situations, which continue to be a source of deep concern. ",claim
"We are particularly disheartened that there have been over 3,000 casualties to date, and a large number of internally displaced persons, whose situation becomes increasingly precarious with the onset of the winter. ",premise
"reports of widespread human rights violations by illegal armed groups, involving killings, abductions, arbitrary detention and torture, speak to the urgency of bringing perpetrators to justice and establishing accountability. ",premise
we would like to reiterate that an inclusive political process is the essential foundation for a stable and democratic future for all Ukrainian people. ,premise
"we welcome the progressive steps taken by the Ukrainian Government in implementing the provisions of the Minsk ceasefire memorandum, notably the adoption ofa draft law on amnesty and special status for the eastern region, which is an important step towards a more inclusive political process, which we hope can provide a sound basis for the de-escalation of tensions. ",claim
"the Republic of Korea supports the ongoing diplomatic efforts towards the stabilization of Ukraine, including the recent meetings on the sidelines of the Asia-Europe summit in Milan. ",claim
"While the situation on the ground remains tense, such constructive diplomatic efforts give us reasons for hope. ",claim
We once again encourage all concerned parties to continue exerting maximum efforts to seek a peaceful political solution. ,claim
"We condemn the many cases of killings, abductions, torture, mock executions, forced labour and forced recruitment, for which the armed separatist groups are responsible. ",claim
"The 16 September report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights also mentions the adoption of an illegal criminal code re-establishing the death penalty for certain crimes, the confiscation of housing from people who have fled the conflict, and the public humiliation of political opponents and Ukrainian soldiers who have been taken prisoner. ",premise
Those acts deserve our unanimous condemnation. ,claim
We also condemn the human rights violations committed by the battalions of volunteers working alongside the Ukrainian forces. ,claim
"The Special Monitoring Mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) has, however, not been able to confirm the truth of those allegations ",premise
Ukraine has denied that its forces have used such weapons ,premise
We welcome Ukraine's willingness to cooperate with an impartial and independent investigation to shed light on those serious allegations ,claim
we expect the separatists to do the same ,claim
The attacks on populated areas should be condemned and must stop. ,claim
Ukraine has the right and the obligation to defend its territory against the continuous and repeated violations of its sovereignty and territorial integrity. ,claim
it is essential for Ukraine to respect its international obligations and for its forces to always act in a proportionate and restrained manner. ,claim
with the increasing number of reports of serious violations of international humanitarian law and human rights committed in the conflict zone ,premise
it is crucial to ensure accountability and the fight against impunity ,claim
"The situation in eastern Ukraine should not lead us to forget the problems that have persisted in Crimea since it was illegally annexed by Russia, in flagrant violation of the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and General Assembly resolution 68/262. ",claim
"The rights of minorities continue to be violated, especially those of the Crimean Tatars and the Ukrainian- speaking populations, the great majority of whom oppose the recent political changes. ",claim
"We are particularly concerned by the repeated intimidations targeting the Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar People and its members, Crimean Tatar activists and the journalists who cover those events. ",claim
"We welcome the approval, in the context of the trilateral contact group, of the Minsk protocol of 5 September and the Minsk memorandum of 19 September, which represent a step towards a lasting political solution to the crisis. ",claim
"That solution must be based on respect for Ukraine's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity. ",claim
We note the decrease in the overall level of violence following the ceasefire agreement. ,claim
"the ceasefire continues to be repeatedly violated, particularly by the separatists ",claim
we strongly condemn ,claim
"Luxembourg welcomes Ukraine's efforts to implement the commitments it has made, including the Ukrainian Parliament's adoption of legislation providing amnesty and a transitional status of local autonomy. ",claim
We must now redouble our efforts to ensure that the parties fulfil all the other commitments made in the Minsk documents. ,claim
"We welcome the steps taken by the Government of Ukraine aimed at the proper holding of parliamentary elections two days from now, on 26 October. ",claim
Those elections will enable the country to continue the positive reforms that began a few months ago. ,premise
"To ensure free and fair elections, the OSCE electoral mission will play a key role, and my country, like others around the table, will be actively involved in that mission. ",premise
"We call on the Russian Federation to use its influence on the separatists to encourage the proper holding of local elections, scheduled for 7 December, under the new Ukrainian law. ",claim
"only that election will make it possible to elect legitimate representatives of the relevant regions, who will be able to participate in a resumed inclusive national dialogue in Ukraine. ",premise
It is high time to put an end to this conflict ,claim
"which has already led to the deaths of more than 3,700 people, including at least 36 children. ",premise
The agreements reached in Minsk present a unique opportunity that should be seized so as to restore peace. ,claim
It is in no one's interest for a new conflict to take root on the European continent. ,premise
Australia supports the ongoing work of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights on the human rights situation in Ukraine ,claim
"which is so important to enabling the Council to assess developments in Ukraine, a task that is clearly needed by us. ",premise
"There have been some encouraging developments in the reporting period and since then, particularly the ceasefire agreement and the Minsk protocol in early September, the restoration of law and order to some parts of eastern Ukraine, and the partial drawdown of some Russian military personnel and equipment from Ukrainian territory. ",claim
But of grave concern are the continuing hostilities in parts of eastern Ukraine ,claim
which have led to well over 300 fatalities - both civilian and combatants - since the ceasefire began. ,premise
"The latest report details significant casualties, significant numbers of displaced people, the dreadful state of critical infrastructure and of thousands of children who are unable to access education. ",premise
Australia calls for all parties to uphold the ceasefire and to engage in a genuine and constructive dialogue to find a political solution. ,claim
The report paints a very disturbing picture of life in the eastern Ukrainian territories occupied by armed groups. ,premise
we have another United Nations report that documents the breakdown in law and order in areas under separatist control. ,premise
"The reports of abductions for ransom and forced labour, torture and extrajuducial killings are all the hallmarks ofcriminality and illegitimacy. ",claim
The killing of a staff member of the International Committee of the Red Cross by shelling in Donetsk is deplorable and highlights once again the need for all parties to respect international humanitarian law. ,claim
Any violations of international humanitarian law by any party to the conflict must be properly investigated and the perpetrators held accountable. ,claim
"Upholding the ceasefire is clearly an important enabling step towards a political solution, but so, too, is the preservation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. ",claim
"We are troubled by credible reports, including from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), of significant numbers of foreign fighters continuing to move across the Russian border into Ukraine and of large-scale attacks against Ukrainian border checkpoints. ",premise
That must stop. ,claim
"The Ukrainian-Russian border must be secured, ideally with permanent monitoring under expanded OSCE verification. ",claim
It is disturbing that Russia has blocked that. ,claim
We note the reports of the possible use of banned munitions and of indiscriminate shelling. ,premise
We also note that the Government of Ukraine has denied having had a role in any such abuses. ,premise
they should cease. ,claim
the ongoing violation of the ceasefire prevents the resettlement of the many thousands of internally displaced persons that the conflict has generated. ,claim
that is particularly worrying given the onset of winter. ,premise
"Ukrainians have the right for those elections to be free, fair and transparent. ",premise
they should be held without external interference. ,claim
They must take place in a secure environment that protects freedom of expression and peaceful assembly and association within Ukraine's legislative framework. ,claim
Announcements by the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics that they intend to hold separate elections in November contravene both the letter and the spirit of the Minsk protocol and undermine efforts towards finding a sustainable political solution within Ukraine's legislative framework. ,premise
Those purported elections can have no legitimacy. ,claim
"the parallel governance structures being created in Donetsk and Luhansk do not comply with international norms and standards or, of course, with Ukraine's Constitution. ",premise
"The report again draws the Council's attention to disturbing, multiple and ongoing human rights violations in the illegally annexed territory of Crimea, including the imposition ofRussian laws that restrict the freedoms of expression, peaceful assembly, association and religion. ",premise
The persecution and intimidation of Crimea's Tatar population is unacceptable. ,claim
"The international dimensions of the conflict in Ukraine are known to us all, including the families in Australia still grieving the loss of their loved ones on Flight MH-17. ",claim
"All available information, including the independent preliminary investigation report of the Dutch Safety Board, is consistent with the assessment that Flight MH-l7 was shot down by a surface-to- air missile fired from a location under the control of Russian-backed separatists. ",premise
"Australia, along with our Dutch and Malaysian partners, remains committed to returning to the crash site when conditions are safe to do so and to doing all that it can to bring to justice those responsible for the downing of Flight MH-17 and the murder of all those on board. ",claim
we must not overlook the root cause of the situation in eastern Ukraine: Russia's persistent campaign of deliberate destabilization. ,claim
there is a clear path towards an end to the violence in eastern Ukraine. ,claim
"Russia must withdraw all its support to separatists, remove all its military forces and assets from Ukrainian territory, respect Ukraine's borders, observe its obligations under the Minsk agreements and engage in genuine dialogue with Ukraine. ",claim
Russia's continued refusal to heed the international community's call to de-escalate this crisis can lead only to Russia's further isolation. ,claim
"since the signing of the Minsk agreements between the Ukrainian Government and eastern militias at the beginning of September, there have been no large-scale armed clashes in eastern Ukraine. ",premise
"the security situation on the ground still remains fragile with sporadic violent attacks in violation of the ceasefire agreement, causing casualties and damage to infrastructure ",claim
The top priority now is forthe parties concerned to implement effectively and comprehensively the Minsk agreements and to ensure the realization of a ceasefire and cessation of violence in eastern Ukraine. ,claim
That is the fundamental way to ease the humanitarian situation of the country ,premise
it will create the necessary conditions for the provision of humanitarian assistance. ,premise
China maintains its consistent position that the United Nations human rights organs and international humanitarian relief agencies should adhere to the principles of objectivity and neutrality in carrying out their work. ,claim
The question of Ukraine involves a complex history that has a bearing on contemporary issues. ,premise
The parties concerned should address the root of the problem and find a fundamental solution. ,claim
"While the legitimate rights, interests and claims of all regions and ethnic groups in Ukraine should be fully accommodated, attention must be given to addressing the legitimate concerns of the parties and to achieving a balance of interests among all parties. ",premise
A political solution is the only proper way to solve the question of Ukraine. ,claim
"The international community should prevail on the parties concerned to make full use of existing communication channels and opportunities for dialogue, take actions conducive to the establishment of mutual trust and avoid confrontation. ",claim
China supports any effort that will help the parties to engage in dialogue and consultations leading to a political settlement of the crisis ,claim
and we will continue to play an active and constructive role in seeking a political settlement of the question of Ukraine ,claim
"In the intervening months more than 3,700 people have been killed, more than 9,000 civilians have been wounded and more than 824,000 Ukrainians have been driven from their homes. ",premise
"There are over 430,000 internally displaced persons. ",premise
"The first is putting a stop to the hostilities and ensuring respect for the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. ",claim
"The second is promoting genuine dialogue among Ukrainians, fostering national reconciliation, establishing self-governance and promoting rights for minorities. ",claim
"And the third is securing a diplomatic settlement to the crisis, involving the countries and organizations of the region. ",claim
"Rwanda welcomes the signing of the l2-point Minsk protocol agreement on 5 September, which declared a ceasefire in eastern Ukraine, as well as its implementation memorandum of 19 September under the auspices ofthe trilateral contact group. ",claim
"We note with satisfaction the steps already taken by President Petro Poroshenko and the Ukrainian Parliament to implement both agreements, namely the implementation of the ceasefire, the exchange of detainees and the adoption of laws on amnesty and self- governance. ",claim
"We believe that the parliamentary elections on Sunday will help implement those agreements, ",claim
as they are critical to the consolidation of democracy and to diversity and the rule of law in Ukraine. ,premise
"We are, however, concerned by the inflammatory statements of armed separatists denouncing those elections ",claim
we emphasize that only elections organized by the legitimate Government in Kyiv will be constitutional and in line with the Minsk agreements. ,claim
"we are perturbed by the statement of the Prime Minister of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic officially declaring the end of the ceasefire, in the wake of regular violations by armed parties. ",premise
"we reiterate our call on all illegal armed groups in Ukraine, mainly in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions to lay down their arms ",claim
we urge the trilateral contact group to use its influence to ensure that the work of the Special Monitoring Mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe is not hindered and that the Minsk protocol is fully respected ,claim
We condemn the continuing terror activities of armed groups in areas under their control ,claim
"where they have perpetrated killings, abductions, torture, ill treatment and other serious human rights abuses, including the destruction of housing and seizure of property. ",premise
We equally condemn the violations of international human rights law by some of the volunteer battalions under the control of the Government of Ukraine. ,claim
"we express our concern about the use of heavy weaponry and the indiscriminate shelling of densely populated areas, including through the reported use of cluster munitions. ",claim
"In the light of the response of the Ukrainian Government, which denied the use of illegal munitions ",premise
"we hope that a full, thorough and independent investigation will be conducted to shed light on those allegations. ",claim
"given the dark picture of the human rights situation in Ukraine, ",premise
Rwanda urges all warring parties to comply with international humanitarian and human rights law. ,claim
"We welcome the commitment of the Ukrainian Government to investigate the reported human rights violations, including the reports of mass graves, and we stress that the perpetrators, including those who bear the command responsibility, should be held accountable. ",claim
"with the ongoing fighting, the fast-approaching winter season and the current gas shortage in Ukraine, ",premise
the eastern part of the country is heading towards a humanitarian catastrophe. ,claim
"We therefore call on the political leaders in Ukraine, and those who have influence over them, to show leadership and a sense of responsibility by making sure that the ceasefire holds firm and by finding a lasting political and diplomatic solution to a crisis that has been going on for too long. ",claim
"Chad continues to be gravely concerned by the deteriorating security and humanitarian situation in Ukraine, especially in the eastern part of the country. ",claim
"Chad notes that despite the Minsk agreement of 5 September, which includes the ceasefire agreement, ",premise
the use of heavy weapons and bombings in inhabited areas continue on a daily basis. ,claim
the Ukrainian army and separatist forces are using cluster bombs in their confrontations in eastern Ukraine. ,claim
such weapons cause severe harm. ,premise
"Sometimes, when a bomb does not explode immediately, it becomes the equivalent of a mine. ",premise
Chad emphatically condemns the use of those weapons of mass destruction in violation of international treaties and calls for an immediate cessation of hostilities. ,claim
the figures demonstrate that civilian victims have increased sharply in this situation of intensified combat. ,premise
"According to the report of the Office of the High Commissioner of Human Rights, over 3,000 people have been killed to date and 9,000 have been injured in eastern Ukraine. ",premise
"Despite the truce of7 September, another 350 people have been killed. ",premise
"As for the internally displaced persons, Ukraine has over 400,000. ",premise
It is a dire moment. ,claim
"The majority of the population in the conflict zones are facing substantial difficulties, with no access to education, sanitary facilities, shelter or work. ",claim
"with the advent of winter and the stalemate in the negotiations between the Russian Federation and Ukraine on the provision of natural gas, we fear that millions of people will be subjected to an untenable situation. ",claim
"thousands of people have been deprived of income because nearly 40,000 small and medium-sized businesses have closed shop due to the fighting. ",premise
"war-related practices - torture, abduction, illegal detention, intimidation, confiscation of goods, summary and arbitrary execution and acts of sexual violence - are being committed against the civilian population by Government forces as well as by separatists ",premise
and are unacceptable ,claim
Chad condemns all acts of violence and violations of human rights and international humanitarian law. ,claim
Given the scope of the conflict and despite the repeated calls of the international community and the Security Council ,premise
"Chad believes that the situation is not simply fragile, as stated in the report; rather, we are on the verge of an acute humanitarian crisis. ",claim
"Chad urges the parties to the conflict to exercise restraint and calm, and calls on the countries with influence over the actors on the ground to exert all efforts to find a political solution to the crisis, which has lasted too long. ",claim
Chad congratulates the Government of Ukraine on its peacemaking and peacebuilding efforts in Ukraine. ,claim
First was the signing of the Minsk accord and memorandum under the auspices of the Trilateral Contact Group on 19 September. ,premise
"Then, on 16 September, the Ukrainian Parliament ratified the law on special autonomy for certain regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, the law on amnesty and the immediate release of all hostages and detained persons. ",premise
Those efforts must continue. ,claim
The elections scheduled for Sunday will be another key step of the will for peace in Ukraine. ,claim
"Lasting solutions must be provided to the affected population, making a priority of the structural issues affecting human rights, in conformity with international norms, the recommendations contained in the report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the human rights situation in Ukraine, and in the framework of respect for General Assembly resolution 68/262, on Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. ",claim
Nigeria welcomes the efforts of European leaders towards resolving the crisis in eastern Ukraine. ,claim
The recent meeting between President Putin and President Poroshenko during the Asia-Europe summit has opened a promising vista. ,claim
We see such high-level engagements as providing a platform for exploring ways to end the instability and violence that have engulfed eastern Ukraine. ,claim
We stress that a diplomatic solution is the only viable option for resolving the crisis in Ukraine. ,claim
The Minsk agreement is an encouraging development that provides an avenue for de-escalating tension in eastern Ukraine. ,premise
"We believe that if fully implemented, it could restore peace and stability in the region. ",claim
We therefore strongly urge all parties to abide by their commitments under the provisions of the agreement. ,claim
"Throughout our engagement on this issue, we have stressed adherence to the principles embodied in the Charter of the United Nations, namely, respect for the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of States. ",premise
we condemn the plans by separatist forces to hold local elections in November. ,claim
"It is contrary to the spirit of the Minsk agreement and can further threaten the peace, unity and sovereignty of Ukraine. ",premise
We appeal to Member States with influence over the separatists to prevail on them to drop their plans to hold the elections in the interest of peace and security in Ukraine. ,claim
"This is about the twenty-fifth meeting to date in which we have discussed the internal Ukrainian crisis, which has basically been transformed into a civil war. ",claim
over a period of months Ukraine's slide towards the abyss has only accelerated. ,claim
"From the very beginning of the crisis, we have warned that last winter's events in Ukraine - which were encouraged by crude external interference that led to a coup d'etat - could open a deep division of the country that could be overcome only through national dialogue with the participation of all regions, political powers and ethnic groups and respect for their interests and rights. ",premise
"Those principles, which opened a genuine path towards a peaceful resolution of the conflict, were agreed by Russia, the United States, Ukraine and the European Union on 17 April, in Geneva, but they have not been implemented. ",claim
Not everyone among the new-old Ukrainian elite or among its foreign sponsors agreed with them. ,premise
There has been no dialogue or promised constitutional reform. ,claim
"the war party in Kyiv continually received prompting from Western capitals to conduct a punitive operation, to fight dissent, thus undermining economic, cultural and humanitarian links with Russia. ",claim
"we urged the parties involved to stop tearing Ukraine apart and setting before it the false choice of being either with the European Union (EU) and the West, or with Russia. ",claim
"Today in Kyiv and in Brussels, as a matter of fact, everyone has returned to the issue we should have started with - delaying the association agreement with the EU, which the ousted President Yanukovych had sought to postpone ",premise
"The cost of delaying that decision for almost a year is thousands of lives, almost a million refugees and internally displaced persons, a destroyed economy and a civil war, and the very severe situation being endured by civilians in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, to whom we will continue to provide urgent humanitarian assistance. ",premise
"We are ready to cooperate with the Ukrainian authorities and with the International Committee of the Red Cross to that end, but we will accept no obstruction, whatever the hypocrites may say. ",claim
Some colleagues on the Council and other lofty bodies have stated more than once that the Maidan uprising and the following internal political processes resulted from the democratic aspirations of the Ukrainian people and their expectations with regard to European values and rule of law. ,premise
That is commendable. ,claim
There are those in Ukraine who truly desire the civilized development of their country ,claim
"there are many such people, and we can only commiserate with them. ",claim
The current election campaign is especially characterized by bad faith and cynicism. ,claim
"The political field has been cleansed of competitors, both figuratively and literally. ",premise
"A law on lustration has been adopted, which is the precursor of a major witch hunt. ",premise
Dissent is subject to intimidation and violence. ,premise
Lynch mobs are modelled on foreign exemplars. ,premise
Media outlets that stray from the general line are being closed. ,premise
"If a television channel broadcasts in Russian or if a newspaper even contains the word ""Russian"" in its name, it is immediately considered to be separatist. ",premise
"Against that background, our concern about Ukraine arises from the growth of neo-Nazi sentiment there, encouraged by authorities in Kyiv. ",claim
"On 14 and 15 October in Kyiv, Kharkiv, Odessa and a number of other cities in Ukraine, parades of torch-carrying neo-Nazis with fascist insignia were held. ",premise
At meetings people quote Hitler. ,premise
There are calls for violent actions against representatives of different ethnic groups. ,premise
"Following precedents that are unfortunately known in history, there have been public burnings ofundesirable publications in Kyiv ",premise
In another act that can only be considered blasphemous the authorities in Kyiv have designated the date of 14 October - the date on whichthe so-called Ukrainian Insurgent Army was formed - as the Day of the defence of the Fatherland. ,premise
"That group was guilty of criminal collaboration with the Nazis during the Second World War, having been involved in the murder of tens and hundreds of thousands of innocent people - Jews, Poles, Russians, even Ukrainians who refused to collaborate with them. ",premise
It is particularly unacceptable to see such actions on the eve of the seventieth anniversary of the victory in the Second World War. ,claim
That proclamation grossly violates the General Assembly resolution 67/154 - adopted seven times at the initiative of the Russian Federation - which condemns the celebration of Nazis as heroes. ,premise
"Furthermore, that proclamation poses a serious threat to the post-war world order and to international peace and security. ",premise
Our eloquent Western colleagues have said nothing about that - as if they had lost their sense of smell. ,premise
We think it strange and unacceptable that the topic was completely left out of today's briefings by the United Nations officials ,claim
"We call on them to focus, as a priority, on combating the glorification of Nazism and countering attempts to rewrite history. ",claim
Prospects for a political resolution in Ukraine have taken on a realistic character since the signature in September of the Minsk protocol and the Minsk memorandum. ,premise
"Our hope for those agreements' viability stems from the fact that they are based on direct agreement between Kyiv and the south- eastern part of the country, which was achieved with the contribution of Russia and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. ",claim
Such was not the case in the past. ,premise
major military clashes have been brought to an end and major principles of peacekeeping observed. ,claim
It is true that there have been violations. ,premise
But that only points to the need for painstaking work and good-faith international support for the negotiations with a view to ensuring the full implementation of what the representatives of Ukraine and the armed groups agreed to in Minsk. ,claim
President Vladimir Putin ofRussia once again clearly underscored our support for efforts to ensure full implementation of the Minsk agreements. ,claim
the report is very far from being objective. ,claim
"it was the Kyiv authorities that invited the mission in, and they have been guiding its activities. ",premise
certain facts that do not favour the Kyiv authorities cannot be ignored. ,claim
"One can't ignore the violations of the norms of international humanitarian law committed by the Kyiv security forces, blatant facts that include the disappearance of people, killings, looting, extortion and arbitrary detentions, all of which have been carried out by the Ukrainian military and other battalions under the control of the Kyiv authorities, specifically, the Aidar, Azov, Dnepr, Kyiv-l and Kyiv-2 battalions. ",premise
ordinary Ukrainians are being harshly detained under the pretext that they have been involved in terrorism. ,claim
"There is an alarming and growing number of civilian victims, including children, as the result of indiscriminate artillery fire in densely populated areas, as well as the use of heavy weapons, prohibited munitions, including cluster bombs and phosphorus munitions, and tactical rockets. ",premise
"There has been a lack of progress in the investigation into the deaths of people on the ""Maidan"" and the tragedies in Odessa and Mariupol, as well as attempts to meddle with or conceal evidence. ",premise
It is essential to investigate objectively and thoroughly the graves of peaceable citizens found in Nyzhnia Krynka. ,claim
it is clearly not a coincidence that the crash site came under fire from Ukrainian positions on 13 October when the Dutch expert group and the observers of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) were there. ,claim
The reporting in one of the statements we heard today of an unconfirmed version of what happened there is irresponsible. ,premise
"During the years that the peninsula was forced to be part of Ukraine, many socioeconomic problems accumulated. ",premise
Russia will try to solve them in a systematic way. ,claim
That will not be affected by efforts on the part of the Kyiv authorities to take revenge on the population of Crimea for their decision to join Russia. ,claim
The Kyiv authorities have erected all kinds of obstacles and have been  broadcasting anti-Crimean propaganda in an unbridled manner. ,claim
"some members of the Security Council have, as is their custom, expressed unqualified support for all of the actions of the Kyiv authorities, even though the latter represent the party of war. ",claim
That support is based on their cynical geopolitical calculations that have nothing to do with the interests of the Ukrainian people. ,claim
"What everyone, including the Security Council, should in fact be doing is to help the parties to the conflict to maintain complete observance of the ceasefire, prevent bloodshed, and engage in an honest and fundamental national dialogue on issues of constitutional reform and rebuilding a Ukrainian State on a just and inclusive basis. ",claim
It is essential that a clear signal be sent in support of those who are in favour of the peaceful resolution of the situation in Ukraine based on the Geneva document and the Minsk agreements. ,premise
"We are fully committed to protecting and promoting the human rights of all Ukrainian citizens, including those who live in the temporarily occupied Ukrainian territory of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol. ",claim
In order to ensure the proper protection of civil rights and to eliminate the remnants of the totalitarian economy and the injustices of Yanukovych's rule ,premise
Ukraine needs comprehensive reforms. ,premise
"To that end, President Poroshenko has launched a reform strategy for 2020. ",premise
"Its eight priority areas are reform of the judiciary and the fight against corruption, reform of law enforcement bodies, deregulation and development of entrepreneurship, tax reform, decentralization of power and good governance, security and defence-sector reform, and health-care reform. ",premise
Last week Parliament passed a package of anti-corruption measures and legislation aimed at strengthening the rule of law. ,claim
The President also signed a decree initiating work on developing a national human rights strategy. ,claim
The reforms were drafted in close cooperation with civil society and are public-inspired and people-oriented. ,claim
"But even as we work to build a better future, we continue to make it absolutely clear that all crimes, particularly those relating to violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms, must be fully investigated, and those responsible brought to justice. ",claim
That applies to the killings in the Maidan in February as much as it does to the tragedy in Odessa on 2 May. ,premise
The first cases connected to those tragic events are already before the courts. ,premise
"Last week, Human Rights Watch published a report suggesting that the Ukrainian armed forces may have used cluster munitions in Donetsk. ",premise
Our forces have never used cluster munitions or any other prohibited weapons. ,premise
"The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) confirmed on Wednesday that there is no evidence that Ukrainian forces have used such weapons, but we have nothing to hide and are ready for an open and transparent investigation. ",premise
The latest report of the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission presents further details of the appalling human-rights situation in the areas under militant control in eastern Ukraine. ,premise
"It highlights the role of foreign militants, particularly those from the Russian Federation, and the continuing grave human- rights violations committed by illegal armed groups. ",claim
"As the report makes clear, those groups are terrorizing Ukrainian citizens in the areas under their control. ",premise
"They resort to daily acts of abuse, including torture, killings and kidnappings. ",premise
"The report details, for example, the introduction of a criminal code, based on that of the Russian Federation, providing for the establishment of military tribunals and the use of the death penalty. ",premise
We utterly condemn such violations of basic human rights. ,claim
"These are Ukrainians, and their rights are being abused by the militant groups who claim to be protecting them. ",claim
The latest report also draws attention to cases of Ukrainian citizens' capture and subsequent illegal transfer to Russia. ,premise
"One such is the case of a Ukrainian servicewoman, Nadiya Savchenko, who was kidnapped in July on Ukrainian territory by Russian security services and is currently being kept under illegal arrest in Russia. ",premise
"The Russian law-enforcement agencies and courts have handled her case in a very untransparent way, with numerous violations of her rights. ",premise
The Ukrainian film director Oleg Sentsov is also being illegally held captive. ,premise
Russia refuses to grant Ukrainian consular access ,claim
"since he is a resident of Crimea, they now falsely claim, without his permission, that he is a Russian citizen, in a grave violation of his rights as a citizen of Ukraine, as well as contrary to Ukrainian legislation and internationally recognized legal standards. ",premise
"Moreover, according to information the Government of Ukraine has received, both captives have been ill treated in Russian prisons. ",premise
We continue to be gravely concerned about the massive and systematic violations of human rights in illegally occupied Crimea. ,claim
"In complete violation of international law, Russia has forcibly imposed its national legislation there. ",premise
Occupation authorities have also encouraged criminal acts against Crimean Tatars and others belonging to national minorities and religious groups. ,premise
"The Russian authorities have refused to facilitate proper investigations or even to comment on the killings and abductions of pro-Ukrainian and Crimean Tatar activists, who include Reshat Ametov, Tymur Shaymardanov, Seyran Zinedine, Leonid Korzh and Vasyl Chernysh. ",premise
"They have prevented the Tatar leaders Mustafa Jemilev and Rifat Chubarov from travelling to the Crimean peninsula, their historical native land. ",premise
"Illegal detentions, torture, property searches, confiscations, and pressures on business and social activity groups have become daily realities for the residents of Crimea. ",premise
"We demand that Russia, as the temporary occupier of Crimea, stop violating the rights of our citizens. ",claim
At a minimum the situation there must be internationally monitored on a constant basis. ,claim
We welcome the continuing commitment of the United Nations to ensuring that those suffering in Crimea are not forgotten. ,claim
"As President Poroshenko has repeatedly stated, Ukraine is fully committed to a peaceful settlement of the situation in the east of our country. ",claim
"That situation was not of our making, but we are striving to end the bloodshed. ",claim
"Our commitment to finding a peaceful solution resulted in the signing of the Minsk protocol and the Minsk memorandum amoong Ukraine, the OSCE and the Russian Federation, with the participation of representatives of militant groups. ",claim
"Immediately after the signing of the Minsk  protocol, the Ukrainian Government moved quickly to implement the agreement. ",premise
Our Parliament adopted a law on interim local self-government in certain districts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions and set the date for local elections. ,premise
It also adopted a law granting amnesty to those involved in the recent unrest. ,premise
"We entered into talks regarding hostage exchanges, resulting in over 1,000 people being freed. ",premise
"We continued to provide humanitarian relief, working in close partnership with United Nations agencies and other international organizations, and the new law, adopted on Monday, on the temporary status of internally displaced persons will further facilitate our humanitarian efforts. ",premise
"We prepared a plan for economic renewal and growth, including plans for the economic revival of the Donbas region, and have called for a donor conference later this year. ",premise
We have rendered all possible assistance to the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission in order to create conditions for its experts to verify the ceasefire. ,premise
"We fully support current efforts to step up those monitoring efforts, as demanded under articles 2 and 4 of the Minsk protocol, particularly along the Ukrainian- Russian border. ",claim
That is clearly insufficient. ,claim
"It is of grave concern that, despite being a signatory to the agreement, Russia refuses to undertake tangible steps to implement it. ",premise
"It is clear that that is simply a cynical attempt to maintain the daily flows of arms, weaponry and militants from Russia to Ukraine. ",claim
"We have strictly observed the ceasefire regime, the details ofwhich are specified in the Minsk memorandum. ",claim
"Since its signature, the Ukrainian Armed Forces have not undertaken offensive operations and have used their weapons only to defend themselves. ",premise
our goodwill has not been reciprocated. ,claim
"Militant leaders have openly stated their intentions to violate the terms of the ceasefire and their aim of capturing new territories, including the cities of Mariupol and Sloviansk. ",premise
"Fierce fighting has been occurring around Donetsk airport and the outskirts of the towns of Debaltseve and Shchastya, where the militants are trying to extend the area under their control ",premise
It is a tragedy that Ukrainian citizens continue to lose their lives. ,claim
"Since the truce started, the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces have been shelled over two thousand times. ",premise
"As a result of those attacks, 89 Ukrainian servicemen have been killed and 500 wounded. ",premise
"At least 54 Ukrainian civilians have been killed as a result of separatist shelling, including 7 killed by separatist rocket fire near the village of Sartana last week. ",premise
all parties must live up to one hundred per cent of their commitments. ,claim
"The militants, together with Russian troops that continue to remain on our soil, must cease their offensive military actions and end the shelling of civilian areas. ",premise
All foreign military personnel must leave the territory of Ukraine. ,premise
"The Russian Federation must cease its illegal supplies of weapons and equipment, limit the flow of so-called volunteers across our sovereign border and allow us to re-establish proper controls. ",premise
"Unfortunately, what we are now seeing is the continuation of a military build-up by Russia along our border and in north Crimea. ",premise
The illegal militant groups have been able to strengthen their military capabilities and are now threatening to seize other cities of Ukraine by further offensive military actions. ,premise
we are simply urging Russia and its pro-Russian separatist allies to live up to the agreements they freely entered into. ,claim
we warn them to refrain from any provocations aimed at disrupting the coming elections. ,claim
Both those votes are an integral part of the peace process and are vital for an inclusive dialogue at the national level. ,claim
They will identify parliamentary representatives from all regions of Ukraine and legitimate local representatives in the Donbas. ,premise
But it is important that everyone's voice is heard. ,premise
"Therefore, we urge that free and secure access to polling stations be granted to those Ukrainian citizens who reside in the areas that remain under militant control. ",claim
We call on Russia to unequivocally condemn the attempts by the illegal armed groups to hold their own local elections on 2 November. ,claim
"Moscow must make clear to the militant authorities that that effort will hinder the peace process and that the results of that illegal vote, organized in violation of Ukrainian legislation, will never be recognized. ",claim
Ukraine has suffered immense upheaval. ,claim
Our territory has been illegally occupied and our borders violated. ,premise
"Russia has instigated a brutal insurgency in the Donbas region that has led to the loss of numerous lives, including the passengers of Flight MH-l7, shot down by a separatist missile. ",claim
International law has been trampled and the human rights of Ukrainian citizens abused. ,claim
But the crisis in our country is not yet over. ,premise
We need he Council's help now more than ever to bring an end to the violence. ,claim
In September we engaged in arrangements with the hope of ending the bloodshed and ensuring sustainable peace. ,claim
To fulfil that goal the terms of the agreement must be implemented in full by all involved in the trilateral dialogue. ,premise
We urge the Council to hold all signatories to their commitments. ,claim
"I believe that it is inappropriate to bring to the Security Council discussions that are ongoing in the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), particularly in regard to the implementation of the provisions of the Minsk agreements regarding border monitoring. ",claim
The ceasefire did not take place. ,claim
"However, we went even further. ",claim
"even in the absence of a ceasefire, we would be ready to deploy the observers on the Russian side of the Russian-Ukrainian border. ",premise
That was a significant gesture by the Russian Federation ,claim
any criticism in that regard is unacceptable ,claim
"The sequence is first and foremost based on the implementation of the ceasefire, which unfortunately did not take place. ",claim
He asserted that civilians are dying as a result of such shelling. ,premise
that is of course very unfortunate. ,claim
"civilians, sometimes as many as 19 people in one day, are dying in the Donbas region as a result of shells being fired by the Ukrainian Armed Forces. ",claim
"The representative of Ukraine says that its armed forces are not responsible, but what about the battalions under Ukrainian command? ",premise
It seems that they are under such command but the impression is that they are not. ,claim
"our Ukrainian colleague could do no better than give an unverified version of events, according to which a separatist missile shot down the Malaysian Airlines flight. ",premise
I want to reiterate that it is irresponsible to voice unverified accounts in the Security Council. ,claim
False information that was supposed to affirm a particular version of events was given. ,claim
"Because if one has information, why not share it? ",premise
Why keep it secret? ,premise
What is more serious is the fact that our experts have drawn up some 40 important questions that need to be answered in order to understand what happened. ,premise
The Ukrainian representative has made no attempt to reply to a single one of those questions. ,premise
It is time for him to cease - in particular at Security Council meetings - his endless repetitions of unverified versions of events and to answer those questions. ,claim
I would like to agree with my Russian colleague on the importance of answering all questions that need to be answered in respect of the independent investigation that is currently under way with regard to Flight MH-l7. ,claim
That investigation is independent. ,claim
It is being undertaken by an independent body - the Dutch Safety Board. ,premise
Participation in that investigation includes two Russian experts. ,premise
"Our Australian experts are, of course, participating in that investigation, but I, as a member ofthe Australian Government, do not have access to the nature or detail of that participation. ",premise
It is an independent investigation that has drawn up one preliminary report so far but which continues. ,claim
I therefore agree with my Russian colleague that such kinds of questions need to be looked at. ,claim
But the fact is that we have an independent investigation. ,claim
"It enjoys the participation of all those who need to be involved, including Russian experts, and is being undertaken in accordance with accepted international guidelines ",premise
"I said was that all the apparent evidence that has been produced so far, while not conclusive, is consistent with the initial assessment that that event, that atrocity, was consistent with a surface-to-air missile from the areas and in the terms that I mentioned. ",claim
I did not assert that that was a definitive conclusion - certainly not yet ,claim
I regret that it continues to use such unconstructive rhetoric. ,claim
"The Government of Ukraine condemns all crimes, especially serious crimes in breach of international law. ",claim
Any such crimes should be properly investigated. ,claim
"Russia is casting such unfounded allegations against Ukraine in order to distract the attention of the international community from the main issue, which is the Russsian aggression against Ukraine and its interference into the domestic affairs of my country. ",claim
"The occupation of Crimea, the instigation of unrest in eastern Ukraine and the supply of weapons and manpower for the needs of the separatist movements in Ukraine are among the main causes of those dramatic events. ",premise
"I have not heard from the Russian delegation a firm willingness to comply strictly with the Minsk arrangements, to which it is a party. ",premise
We have not heard any expression of Russia's firm intention to withdraw its troops from Ukraine or its readiness to cooperate with Ukraine in establishing effective control over the State border. ,premise
"We have not heard a condemnation of the serious crimes committed by the illegal armed groups, crimes that are clearly reflected in the United Nations Monitoring Mission's report. ",premise
"We also had expected that Russia would condemn the intentions of the separatists to hold local elections on 2 November, an act that would Violate the Minsk arrangements, signed by Ukraine and Russia. ",premise
"It would be quite difficult to settle the situation in eastern Ukraine without addressing that issue, as noted in our statement today. ",claim
The leadership of Ukraine has demonstrated by its deeds its readiness and willingness to work for a peaceful resolution. ,claim
It is time for the other parties to step up and show their sincere will to engage in dialogue. ,claim
"I do not think we need to have a broad discussion on the independent investigation, but I am very happy that he sounded so constructive about the investigation. ",claim
The Australian Permanent Representative stated that the version referred to today is supposedly generally accepted or that it might be the version resulting from such an investigation. ,premise
That simply is not the case. ,claim
"It was just a version constructed by the United States, which did not provide any justification. ",premise
That version simply stated that a missile was fired from the region that was supposedly under the control of the separatists. ,premise
We have not heard any proof. ,premise
"Yet a few days after the tragedy, that same region was visited by a journalist from the Russian Service of the BBC, who gave a four-minute report from there, which clearly demonstrated that no one had shot any missiles from that location. ",premise
that report was posted on the BBC website for only half a day and was then taken down. ,premise
I suppose it was not considered interesting enough to remain. ,claim
Russia's flagrant violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. ,claim
"Time and again, Russia has made commitments and then failed to live up to them, and subsequently offered explanations to the Council that it knows are untrue. ",claim
"The most recent example involves the joint commitments made by Russia, the separatists it supports and Ukraine on 5 September in Minsk. ",premise
"They include an immediate end to the ceasefire violations, the restoration of Ukrainian control of its side of the international border, OSCE monitoring of the border and a security zone on either side of the border, as well as the withdrawal of foreign forces, mercenaries and equipment from Ukraine and the release of hostages and prisoners. ",premise
On none of those have Russia or the separatists lived up to their word. ,claim
the separatists have taken advantage of the agreed-upon pause in the fighting to try and expand their territory beyond Minsk lines. ,claim
"Meanwhile, Ukraine has maintained a full ceasefire along the agreed lines, as it defends its forces and population from separatists' push for more. ",claim
"At Minsk, all sides committed to permitting the OSCE to monitor and verify the ceasefire. ",premise
Yet Russian- backed separatists have fired on OSCE monitoring drones and used jamming signals to interfere with its team members' electronics using equipment supplied by Moscow. ,claim
"At Minsk, all sides agreed to permanent monitoring at the Ukrainian-Russian State border and the creation of a security zone along the border. ",premise
Yet Russia has done nothing to restore Ukrainian Government control over the international border. ,claim
"Russia has refused to press separatists to allow the OSCE access to the border, and Russia continues to flout Ukrainian air space with its helicopters and unmanned aerial vehicles. ",premise
It also continues to send so-called humanitarian convoys - convoys it will not allow Ukrainian customs authorities or international monitors to search. ,premise
"At Minsk, all sides committed to immediately free all hostages and illegally held persons. ",premise
Yet Russia and the separatists it backs continue to hold approximately 500 captives. ,claim
"Those captives include Ukrainian pilot Nadia Savchenko and Ukrainian film director Oleg Sentsov, both of whom were captured by separatists on Ukrainian soil and illegally transported against their will to Russia. ",premise
"At Minsk, Russia committed to remove all illegal military formations, military equipment and militants from Ukraine. ",premise
"Yet, rather than withdrawing its military forces from Ukraine and rather than cutting off its support for separatists, Russia is instead surging more forces and more equipment across the border. ",claim
The Russian military has maintained a forward presence in eastern Ukraine since the ceasefire took effect. ,claim
We have information indicating that a Russian air-defence system was operating near one of the separatist convoys in Donetsk. ,premise
"Russia has not provided that type of air- defence system to separatists to date, suggesting that Russian forces were protecting the convoy. ",premise
"On 9 November, the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission reported two convoys of 17 unmarked green trucks moving west through Donetsk towards the ceasefire line. ",premise
"Yesterday, 11 November, OSCE monitors observed the movement of 43 unmarked military vehicles on the eastern outskirts of Donetsk. ",premise
Five were seen towing l20-millimetre howitzers and five others were towing multiple-launch rocket systems. ,premise
"NATO confirmed it had observed columns of Russian equipment - primarily Russian tanks, Russian artillery, Russian air-defence systems and Russian combat troops - entering Ukraine over the past 48 hours. ",premise
"The list goes on, but the pattern is clear. ",premise
"Where Russia has made commitments, it has failed to meet them. ",claim
"Russia negotiated a peace plan, then systematically undermined it at every step ",claim
"It talks of peace, but it keeps fuelling war. ",claim
That is not all. ,claim
"On 2 November, Russian-backed separatists held illegal elections in the parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions that they control. ",premise
The elections contravene Ukraine's laws and its sovereignty. ,premise
They defied point 9 of the Minsk protocol. ,premise
"But if Russia and the separatists intended the elections to cast a veneer of legitimacy on their actions, they failed. ",claim
"Instead, the world saw the elections for what they are: a shameless attempt to validate territory seized at the barrel of the gun - a gun provided by Russia. ",claim
"In keeping with its efforts to escalate rather than de-escalate at every turn, rather than condemn the separatists"" sham election like most of the international community, Russia encouraged it. ",premise
"Russian and separatist actions in eastern Ukraine currently have nothing to do with improving the humanitarian situation in Donbas, or decentralizing power, as called for in points 3 and 8 of the Minsk protocol. ",claim
"A recent Associated Press (AP) report from the rebel-held town of Perevalsk, part of the territory that recently declared independence from Ukraine, revealed the town was ruled by a local warlord who goes by the name of ""batya"" - or ""daddy"". ",premise
"Daddy's power is maintained by a group of armed Cossacks, whom he calls his Great Don Army, and four tanks outside his office fly Russian and rebel flags. ",premise
"Asked where his authority came from, Daddy told the AP reporter:  ""We are an independent organization and we don't depend on anyone ",premise
"I am answerable only to President Putin and Our Lord."" ",premise
In neighbouring Alchevsk village rebel leaders preside over the kangaroo trials of people accused of crimes. ,premise
"Defendants are not given lawyers and their judges are whatever members of the community show up, who vote by a simple show of hands. ",premise
That is what the separatist democracy looks like. ,claim
"We continue to see similar repressive tendencies in Russian-occupied Crimea, where members of the Tatar minority have been relentlessly persecuted and the free press muzzled. ",premise
"By contrast, Ukraine has made a genuine effort to live up to its agreements at Minsk and continues to show considerable restraint in response to constant provocation and attack. ",claim
"The Ukrainian people have repeatedly chosen leaders who call for de-escalation over escalation, first in the presidential election and then in parliamentary elections. ",premise
Ukraine has also put in motion critically important reforms to reduce corruption and grant greater authority to its regions through constitutional reform. ,premise
It has sought to maintain the ceasefire along the lines established at Minsk. ,premise
"The United States continues to support the Minsk peace process, and we continue to call for its full implementation. ",claim
"We remain prepared to roll back sanctions if the fighting stops, the border is closed, the foreign forces and equipment are withdrawn and hostages are released. ",claim
there is no military solution to the crisis. ,claim
"The solution, as has been said, by the OSCE here today and United Nations, must be political. ",claim
"The problem is, as it has long been throughout this crisis, you cannot reach a political solution if only one side is committed to forging it, and you cannot effectively implement a road map with parties who, like the Russians and the separatists they back, so consistently fail to keep their word. ",claim
"We have seen Russia's playbook in Transnistria, South Ossetia, Abkhazia and Crimea - so the question is not what Russia will try to do in eastern Ukraine, the question is what we, the international community, will seek to do to prevent yet another frozen conflict in Europe manufactured by Russia. ",premise
"The Minsk agreement was brokered under the auspices of the international community; as such, there must be consequences when Russia flouts the commitments it has made and continues to destabilize its neighbour. ",premise
Russia has not earned the good faith we would wish to bestow. ,claim
"Even when Russia claims, as Foreign Minister Lavrov did today, ""the inadmissibility of disrupting the implementation of the Minsk ceasefire agreements"" actions are all that matter - and actions alongside these words show intentions. ",premise
"The Donetsk airport has come under attacks from artillery and arms fire four times in the past 24 hours, and in the past day Ukrainian positions have been shelled near Debaltseve, Avdiyivka, Hirske and Krasnohorivka. ",premise
What we can do - what we must do - is keep ratcheting up the pressure on Russia until it abides by Minsk and chooses the path of de-escalation. ,claim
Russia's actions in Ukraine are a threat not only to the countries in Russia's immediate vicinity but also to the international order. ,claim
"the security situation in Ukraine has deteriorated further, despite the extensive diplomatic efforts deployed in the region over the past month. ",claim
"It seems that when the region takes a step forward, the parties respond with two steps backwards, at the expense of the civilian population. ",claim
"We should remember, as Ambassador Tagliavini has reminded us, that winter is around the corner and that with increased fighting, coupled with a shortage of gas in Ukraine, a humanitarian disaster is looming. ",premise
"It is disappointing that despite the signing of the Minsk protocol and memorandum on 5 and 19 September, respectively, the parties seem unwilling to implement those agreements. ",claim
"We are seriously concerned about the continued violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, the massive reinforcement of the armed separatists with heavy weaponry, including via military convoys, as well as the continued shelling in populated areas, including, last week, ofa school. ",premise
"In that context, we commend the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission for its continuing role in verifying the ceasefire on Ukraine's eastern border. ",claim
"We urge all parties, particularly the armed separatists, to assist the Mission in implementing its mandate, and we also encourage those who have the capacity to provide the monitors with the equipment they need to do so, in order to improve the success of its activities. ",claim
"It is unfortunate that the deterioration of the security situation in Ukraine comes on the heels of the parliamentary elections of 26 October, which were viewed as free, fair and peaceful, despite the fact that there were no polling stations in the rebel-held areas. ",premise
we believe that the subsequent elections organized on 2 November by the armed separatists are unconstitutional and undermine the Minsk protocol and memorandum. ,claim
"In a context of heightened tension and escalation, we note with concern statements from all sides that may jeopardize even the provisions of the Minsk agreements that had begun to be implemented, such as those on the exchange ofprisoners of war and the law on interim local self-government. ",premise
"It is therefore imperative that, given the alarming situation, all the signatories recommit to implementing the Minsk agreements and that members of the Trilateral Contact Group use their influence to end the dangerous escalation. ",claim
"Otherwise, despite our collective commitment made yesterday on the occasion of Remembrance Day, the situation could get out of hand and lead to another full-blown regional war on the European continent. ",premise
the situation in Ukraine has become a threat to international peace and security ,claim
"I believe it is time for the 15 to at least agree that the Council should remain seized of the matter under a specific agenda item, ""The situation in Ukraine"". ",claim
"Jordan is extremely concerned by the worsening security situation and the increase in shelling in eastern Ukraine, which follows a period of tenuous calm in the region. ",premise
there could be spillover effects beyond Ukraine and into the entire region. ,claim
"Jordan believes that the military build-up and the illegal flow of weapons into Ukraine, as stated in the report of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, are violations of the Minsk agreements. ",claim
Any attempt by the parties to resume the fighting flouts international efforts aimed at reaching a lasting and peaceful solution to the conflict. ,premise
"We reiterate our call to all parties, in particular armed groups, to show restraint and discipline, calm the situation and make intensive, serious and sincere efforts to prevent a further worsening of the situation, which would be dire for all concerned. ",claim
"Any deferral of a political solution based on the peace agreements will only further exacerbate violence and instability and bring about a worsening of the humanitarian situation, which must be addressed. ",premise
Any delay will only further prolong the ongoing investigation of the Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-l7 crash. ,premise
"The shared challenges have to be tackled by all Ukrainians across the board, be they in the east or the west of the country. ",premise
"I am referring to the political reforms, national reconciliation and economic development. ",premise
Those shared challenges and can be tackled only through cooperation among all the parties so as to ensure that the conflict not worsen irreversibly. ,premise
"In that regard, the holding of legislative elections in the country on 26 October was an important step on the path to political reform, which the Ukrainian Government has committed itself to. ",claim
We therefore encourage the Government to continue its efforts to step up the national dialogue and to put in place all the necessary political and economic reforms that can contribute to the national reconciliation process among all members of Ukrainian society ,claim
Jordan will continue to back the Minsk agreements. ,claim
"We stress the importance of cooperation among all parties for a comprehensive and swift implementation of all the provisions of the agreements, including provisions regarding the ceasefire and the halting of weapons flows. ",claim
"We emphasize the need to uphold and maintain the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine, as undermining those would be a violation of international law. ",claim
We also recall that it is crucial that there be no impunity or immunity for those having perpetrated violations or acts of violence. ,claim
We further recall that such individuals must be brought before justice to ensure that the situation in Ukraine not further deteriorate. ,claim
"Luxembourg fully supports the efforts of the Swiss Chairman-in-Office of the OSCE to find a political solution to the crisis, while fully upholding the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. ",claim
"We also support the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission, which has a key role to play to promote the de-escalation of tensions by providing objective information on the situation on the ground. ",claim
"We are very concerned by the serious deterioration of the situation in eastern Ukraine since 2 November, when the separatists held illegal elections in the regions of the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts under their control. ",claim
non-compliance with key provisions of the Minsk agreements has led to a new escalation of tensions and a worsening situation in several regions of eastern Ukraine. ,claim
The growing number of violations of the 5 September ceasefire agreement are compounded by worrisome omens. ,claim
We are concerned about the recent build-up of Russian troops in the immediate proximity of the Ukrainian border. ,premise
We are also concerned about the increased movements of military convoy in separatist-controlled areas heading for Ukrainian army positions. ,premise
"As has been noted, in recent days the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission has reported sightings of large convoys of military trucks without license plates transporting troops and heavy weapons, including howitzers. ",premise
"A convoy of nine tanks - four T-72s and five T-64s - heading west was observed by the Mission on Saturday, 8 November. ",premise
"These movements of troops and heavy weaponry are accompanied by intensified bombing, especially in Donetsk ",claim
"We condemn the sham elections held on 2 November in the eastern regions of Ukraine controlled by the separatists, with the blessing of Russia. ",claim
We do not recognize those elections. ,claim
They are illegal under the Constitution and Ukrainian law. ,premise
They constitute a flagrant violation of the commitments that Russia and the representatives of illegal armed groups made when signing the Minsk protocol. ,premise
"Those sham elections do not legitimize the warlords at the head of the self- proclaimed republics of Donetsk and Luhansk, just as the illegal referendum in Crimea does not and will not legitimize the annexation of the peninsula by Russia. ",claim
Successive reports of the Special Monitoring Mission bear witness to serious violations of human rights committed since April in areas occupied by armed separatist groups. ,premise
These individuals cannot claim to speak for the people of Donbas. ,claim
The Secretary-General and the OSCE Chairperson-in-Office have rightly denounced the elections of 2 November as an obstacle to efforts to find a political solution to the conflict ,premise
"We welcome the concrete steps taken by Ukraine to meet its commitments under the Minsk agreements, in particular the adoption of laws providing for amnesty and the temporary status of local autonomy. ",claim
"of particular importance is the withdrawal of armed groups, military equipment, combatants and illegal mercenaries, as well as securing the border between Ukraine and Russia and its permanent monitoring with OSCE verification. ",claim
It is crucial in this context that the Mission's monitoring of the border posts at Gukovo and Donetsk be extended to other border-crossing areas as soon as possible. ,claim
It becomes more urgent every day to end the conflict impacting Ukraine. ,claim
"The conflict has already killed more than 4,000 people since April. ",premise
"The victims include numerous children, including two struck down on 5 November by mortar shells on a school playing field in Donetsk. ",premise
The killing must stop. ,claim
The solution to the conflict has been identified ,claim
"it includes the good-faith implementation of the Minsk protocol of 5 September and the Minsk memorandum of 19 September, signed by all parties to the conflict, with the decisive verification support of the OSCE. ",premise
Ukraine has demonstrated in deed its determination to pursue the path of peace. ,claim
We call on the separatists and Russia to do the same so as to halt the spiral of conflict. ,claim
We call on the Russian Federation to shoulder its responsibilities in the full and complete implementation of the Minsk agreements by preventing all military movement of weapons or combatants from its territory into Ukraine and by exercising its influence on the separatists to fulfil the obligations to which they have subscribed under the Minsk agreements. ,claim
"We are acutely alarmed by the observations reported by the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission, detailing the influx of military equipment, weapons and armed personnel into the region of Ukraine held by armed rebel groups. ",premise
"It represents a clear violation of the Minsk agreements, a serious encroachment on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, and a challenge to the future of the country. ",claim
"The withdrawal of foreign troops and military equipment under OSCE monitoring is an integral part of the Minsk agreements, which must be fully implemented. ",claim
"We urge all concerned parties to stop any provocative actions that may derail the fragile peace process, as embodied in the Minsk agreements. ",claim
All outside military intervention in the situation must cease immediately. ,claim
"Regarding political developments in the country, we welcome the holding of parliamentary elections on 26 October ",claim
which proved to be orderly and peaceful. ,premise
"In that regard, the separate elections held by armed rebel groups in eastern Ukraine earlier this month run counter to the spirit of a dialogue-based resolution of the situation. ",premise
They also undermine the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. ,claim
"We commend the role of OSCE, the United Nations and other partners in seeking a peaceful political resolution of the situation, and we stand ready to support such efforts. ",claim
The situation in Ukraine continues to be a severe threat and indeed an escalating threat to international peace and security. ,claim
There is a reason why that is so. ,premise
"Since the start of the crisis, Russian actions have been consistently designed to undermine, interfere with and transgress Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity in a way that flouts international norms, including the Charter of the United Nations. ",premise
"Since the Council last met on 24 October to discuss Ukraine (see S/PV.7287), Russia and the separatists it supports have repeatedly undermined and ignored the Minsk agreements. ",premise
"Russian leaders have told us one thing and then ordered their military, their special forces and their separatist rebel proxies to do another. ",premise
The ceasefire has been breached. ,premise
Attempts to monitor and verify the ceasefire and the border have been blocked. ,premise
"Russia continues to supply its soldiers in Ukraine and the separatists they fight alongside with heavy weaponry, artillery, tanks and armoured vehicles in flagrant breach of the Minsk protocols. ",premise
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) reporting in recent days lays bare the extent of that Russian support. ,premise
"On several separate occasions, the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission has witnessed significant numbers of troops and military equipment moving in convoy in separatist-held areas. ",premise
"On 8 November, the Mission observed a convoy of more than 40 unmarked military vehicles moving west on the outskirts of Donetsk. ",premise
"It included 19 unmarked Kamaz trucks, each towing a howitzer artillery piece and carrying personnel in green uniforms without insignia; 15 Kraz troop carriers; 6 fuel tankers; and an unmarked Bronetransporter armoured personnel carrier. ",premise
We have seen this pattern before - unmarked columns of military vehicles entering Ukraine to support continued fighting by separatists. ,premise
Efforts to remove markings and insignia from those vehicles cannot disguise the fact that they come from Russia. ,premise
Yet Russia continues to deny that fact ,claim
despite the fact that its attempts at deception turned to farce only yesterday when Russian television station NTV broadcast footage of an armoured personnel carrier at the head of a column in Donetsk bearing markings from the Russian city of Ryazan. ,premise
"If Russia is not supplying separatists across the border, then why does it continue to block any expansion of OSCE border monitoring? ",premise
"Russia must implement the commitment it made at Minsk to allow the monitoring of its border with Ukraine, of which only 2 kilometres are currently observed by the OSCE. ",claim
Flights of OSCE unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) above Donetsk must also be allowed to proceed unhindered. ,claim
OSCE reports that UAVs are being jammed electronically by military- grade equipment call into question the credibility of the commitment towards the Minsk agreements of those who control that territory and their Russian supporters. ,premise
The United Kingdom deeply regrets that illegal elections took place in separatist-controlled areas of Donetsk and Luhansk on 2 November. ,claim
The Secretary- General could not have been clearer in his public message that the elections were illegal under Ukrainian law and seriously undermined the Minsk protocol. ,premise
The Chairperson-in-Office of the OSCE was equally clear that the elections ran counter to the letter and spirit of the Minsk protocol and would further complicate its implementation. ,premise
Russia's refusal to disavow the elections is a continuation of a pattern of Russian behaviour that flouts the Minsk agreements and is designed to destabilize the situation in Ukraine. ,claim
"Although the focus of today's discussion is the increase in fighting and the illegal elections held in eastern Ukraine, the Council must not lose sight of the deteriorating human rights situation in areas under separatist control in eastern Ukraine and in particular in the illegally annexed Crimean peninsula, which the mission of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights is still unable to visit. ",claim
"We continue to receive disturbing reports of intimidation and harassment of Crimean Tatars, ethnic Ukrainians and all those who have refused Russian citizenship. ",premise
The de facto Crimean authorities have undertaken a campaign to rid the Crimean peninsula of its Ukrainian and Tatar identity. ,premise
"Citizenship provisions, the educational syllabus and the media are all being ruthlessly engineered to that end. ",premise
Crimean Tatars are being targeted by security forces; 18 prominent Tatars remain missing and 1 body has been found. ,premise
What we see is that Russia's actions continue to escalate tensions rather than contribute to a peaceful resolution of the crisis. ,claim
"Instead, Russia is taking a cynical and selective approach towards the agreements while it continues its destabilization of Ukraine. ",claim
That must change. ,claim
"We therefore call again on Russia to withdraw its equipment, weapons and troops from Ukrainian territory, as it undertook to do in September, and to use its influence to secure a lasting ceasefire. ",claim
Its continued support for the armed separatists serves only to escalate an already perilous situation and will only lead to a further deterioration in Russia's relations with the international community. ,premise
"While the overall security situation in eastern Ukraine has been stable recently, violent attacks have continued to take place and have caused loss of life and property. ",premise
"At the same time, China welcomes the recent agreement signed between Russia and Ukraine on natural gas and hopes that the agreement will contribute to easing the current tensions and enhancing a political solution to the crisis in Ukraine. ",claim
China believes that a political solution is the only way to resolve the question of Ukraine. ,claim
"For the next stage, all the parties concerned should truly implement the Minsk agreement in a comprehensive manner so as to ensure that a ceasefire is achieved, the violence in eastern Ukraine is brought to an end and the humanitarian situation in affected areas is alleviated. ",claim
The question of Ukraine involves both complex history and current reality. ,premise
"A fundamental solution to the question of Ukraine should take into full account the legitimate rights, interests and wishes of all regions and ethnic groups in Ukraine. ",claim
It should also seek to satisfy the reasonable concerns of all parties and achieve a balance of interests among them. ,claim
"We hope that all parties will continue to engage in constructive dialogue with a View to agreeing on a balanced, lasting and comprehensive political solution. ",premise
All parties should work together to achieve that goal. ,claim
"China has always abided by the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries and respected the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries, including Ukraine. ",claim
China supports all actions that will contribute to dialogue and consultation and to finding a political solution to the crisis. ,claim
China will continue to play a positive and constructive role in favour of a political solution to the question of Ukraine. ,claim
Ukraine entered into a period of unprecedented transformation after years of administrative inefficiencies and political blockage. ,claim
This transformation came from deep within Ukrainian society. ,claim
The elections neatly confirm the fundamental choices of the Ukrainian people in favour of a deep transformation and a deep economic and social modernization of Ukraine. ,premise
The path will be long. ,claim
"Agreed steps must now be translated into the implementation of necessary reforms in the areas of the economy, rule of law, decentralization and reconstruction. ",claim
"since Ukraine has embarked on the path of reform, it has been constrained in moving forward. ",claim
"The separatist agitation helped from outside the country has spread to the eastern part of Ukraine, first in Crimea - annexed in violation of the law - and then in the Donbas region, causing disturbances, human rights violations and a serious humanitarian situation. ",premise
We condemn in the strongest terms this interference in Ukrainian internal affairs ,claim
which has taken place with flagrant disregard for its sovereignty and territorial integrity. ,premise
"As occurred in Crimea in March, so-called elections were held on 2 November by the separatists in the part of Donbas that they occupy. ",premise
"These elections violate the letter and the spirit of the Minsk protocol, which provides for local elections in accordance with Ukrainian law. ",premise
It is essential to quickly reach full compliance with the ceasefire and pursue further negotiations on the provisional status of the regions of the east. ,claim
"These agreements remain a good basis forbringing about an end to the crisis based on three principles: respect for the ceasefire, monitoring of the eastern border of Ukraine, and political discussions for the purposes of finding a lasting solution. ",claim
The priority now must be to remain on the path of dialogue and to continue the implementation of the agreements. ,claim
"Our goal is to bring Ukrainians, separatists and Russians to the negotiating table in order to stop the escalation. ",claim
That is a crucial aspect of the Minsk protocol. ,claim
"Military movements last weekend at the Russian- Ukrainian border, confirmed by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), are cause for great alarm in that respect. ",premise
Several dozens of military vehicles including tanks entered Ukraine in recent days. ,premise
The strengthening of the military presence of the separatists and the proliferation of troop movements have raised fears of renewed fighting on a larger scale. ,premise
The announcement of the creation of a Donbas army and a general mobilization is particularly worrying. ,premise
The separatists and their supporters must prove they are ready for dialogue and the search for peace. ,claim
"In this context, we call once again for Russia to prevent the transfer of arms and men across its border and to use all its influence on the separatists so that the ceasefire is fully respected. ",claim
The issue of monitoring the Russian-Ukrainian border remains a focal point for reaching a political solution to the crisis. ,claim
We expressed our readiness to provide the OSCE with our surveillance capabilities. ,claim
The utility of drones has been shown in that they can be alternative and exclusive sources of information. ,premise
We are in discussions with our Russian and Ukrainian partners on the subject. ,premise
"These discussions are difficult, but they are crucial if there is to be progress. ",claim
We also believe that the mandate of the OSCE mission in Russian territory should be strengthened and expanded as quickly as possible to other border posts. ,claim
"In this context, our political approach is based on firmness and dialogue. ",claim
The sanctions are not intended to punish but to encourage dialogue. ,claim
"Sanctions are a tool, but they are not the only one. ",claim
The conclusion of the negotiations on the supply of natural gas 10 days ago ,premise
a sign that some progress can be achieved through dialogue. ,claim
"Europe gave a clear alternative - heavier sanctions if the destabilizing actions continued and worsened, or a re-examination of the question if the situation on the ground bears witness to a real implementation of the agreements of 5 September. ",claim
It is high time that we all rally in favour of de-escalation and the re-establishment of good-neighbourly relations between independent and sovereign States. ,claim
No one has interest to fan the flames and return to the rhetoric of another century. ,premise
We regret that the Council has had to be convened today and express our deep concern at the further escalation of the crisis in the east and south of Ukraine. ,premise
We are concerned about information with respect to a possible foreign military support in eastern Ukraine and what the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) has told us. ,premise
"It is urgent that the ceasefire be fully respected, monitored and verified by the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission, in accordance with the provisions of the Minsk agreements. ",claim
"We trust that all the parties will be able to implement the Minsk agreement, ",claim
which is an inclusive political instrument aimed at achieving peace and calm for the entire population of eastern Ukraine. ,premise
"We regret the worsening security situation in the east of the country which has had serious consequences for the civilian population, which continues to suffer violations and human rights abuses from all actors. ",premise
"It is urgent that the increasing humanitarian needs in south-eastern Ukraine be addressed, as the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and other United Nations agencies have pointed out. ",claim
The dramatic increase in the number of internally displaced persons is one of the most disturbing elements. ,premise
The delivery of humanitarian assistance must go forward without delay and in accordance with humanitarian principles. ,claim
"The efforts of the international community must be harnessed in support of the host Government, which bears the primary responsibility for assistance and protection. ",claim
"We stress the importance of strengthening the rule of law and the obligation to respect the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, General Assembly resolution 68/262 and international law. ",claim
It is also necessary to observe the principle of non-intervention and non-interference in the internal affairs of another State. ,claim
"Finally, we urge the parties to seek a peaceful solution to this crisis through direct political dialogue, exercise restraint and refrain from unilateral actions that could increase tensions. ",claim
We reiterate our support for the efforts that the Secretary-General and the United Nations continue to undertake to resolve the situation in Ukraine. ,claim
An undeclared war is being waged by Russia against Ukraine. ,claim
it is barely making the world's headlines ,claim
because it is slow and creeping ,premise
"a few more metres of captured land, a few more explosions, a few more Russian tanks, a few more dead at a time. ",premise
"Russia is doing its best to resuscitate the bygone era of division and brinkmanship, continuing its aggression against Ukraine, buttressed by bogus claims of defending Russian speakers from the advances of fascism and by outlandish accusations against Europe and the West. ",claim
"The abduction of an Estonian intelligence officer on the Estonia side of the border and of a Ukrainian pilot in Ukraine; the alarming rise in the intensity and gravity of provocations involving Russian reconnaissance and fighterjets over an increasing territory, from the Baltic Sea region to Portugal, the United States, Canada and Japan ",premise
all point to a more aggressive unilateral Russian military posture going well beyond Ukraine's borders. ,claim
The conflict in Ukraine is not an internal affair. ,claim
It is neither a civil war nor a rebellion of disgruntled citizens. ,claim
"It is Russia's war against Ukraine for daring to choose a different, European path. ",claim
"Sponsored by the Kremlin, the illegal armed separatists, many of whom carry Russian passports, have inflicted heavy damage on the Ukrainian forces and civilian population before and during the ceasefire, using sophisticated weaponry, tanks, multiple rocket launchers and heavy artillery. ",premise
Ukraine honoured the ceasefire agreement ,claim
Russia-backed separatists used the time to rearm and grab more territory. ,claim
those illegal armed groups are probably better armed than some of the smaller European armies ,claim
all thanks to Russia's continued support and supplies. ,premise
"We are profoundly worried by the recent reports of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Special Special Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, registering unmarked convoys of trucks carrying substantial amounts of heavy weaponry, ammunition, Grad multiple-launch rocket systems and howitzers, as well as armoured personnel carriers and tanks, moving cross the border and westwards inside the separatist held areas. ",premise
"That is a clear and blatant violation of the ceasefire agreement, which called for the withdrawal of Russian weapons and troops from Ukraine and a sealing of the border under international observation. ",claim
"Russia single-handedly prevented the expansion of such a presence on the border, as a result of which OSCE observers monitor only 2 kilometres of the Russia-Ukraine border out of a total of 400 kilometres. ",premise
The holding by the separatists ofillegal elections in eastern Ukraine is another clear violation of the Minsk agreements. ,claim
"Russia alone endorsed those sham elections and even arranged the presence of ""observers"" - a bunch of hard-line nationalists, Nazi sympathizers and xenophobes, tried and tested in the illegal plebiscite in Crimea. ",claim
"If Council members google the name of Mateusz Piskorski, they will find him posing in front of a swastika flag. ",premise
"Frank Creyelman is an open xenophobe, known for demanding amnesty for those who collaborated with the Hitler regime during the Second World War. ",premise
Marton Gyongyosy once suggested that Hungarian Jews should be tallied up because they pose a threat to the State. ,premise
Srda Trifkovie is defender of Slobodan Milosevic and an Islamophobe. ,premise
Ewald Stadler is known for delivering one of the most racist speech ever in a European parliament. ,premise
"It is with the help of such odious characters that Moscow is ""fighting Fascism"" in Ukraine. ",claim
Ukraine's population squarely rejected the extreme forces during the recent national elections. ,claim
the myth of Ukraine's fascist junta continues to be advanced by Russia's propaganda machine. ,claim
"since Russian troops ""liberated"" Crimea, the human rights situation in the region has deteriorated dramatically ",claim
the separatist-held regions in eastern Ukraine have been repeatedly described by United Nations human rights reports as an abyss of lawlessness and criminality. ,claim
"Russia's disdain for the internationally accepted norms of behaviour, international law and the Charter of the United Nations is astounding, including the manipulation of all things humanitarian. ",claim
the seventh convoy now to be sent into Ukraine without Ukraine's consent and in violation of Ukraine's borders. ,claim
"While the humanitarian needs in the region have not diminished and remain dire, the armed separatists have been gaining ground with each new convoy. ",premise
"the cost of Russia's aggression against Ukraine is some 400,000 displaced, at least 4,000 killed, over 9,000 wounded, and some 5.2 million people living in conflict-affected areas. ",premise
The result of Russia's aggression against Ukraine ,claim
Russia's own young men returning home dead and anonymous in the notorious Cargo 200 boxes. ,premise
"The Geneva statement, the Berlin joint declaration, the Minsk protocol and Minsk memorandum are the latest additions to the long list of documents and treaties that Russia has breached, from the 1991 Alma- Ata Declaration, the 1994 Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances, the 1997 Black Sea FleetAgreement Between the Russian Federation and Ukraine, and the Charter of the United Nations itself. ",premise
Only a full and sustainable return to the ceasefire by all parties can defuse this increasingly bloody crisis before it gets completely out of hand ,claim
"with Russian troops amassed near Ukraine's borders and increasing military movements in separatist held areas, ",premise
could happen at any time ,claim
"Ukraine has been doing its part, and must continue to do so, by pursuing a wide range of necessary reforms, fighting corruption and reaching out to the affected regions to rebuild popular trust in the national Government. ",claim
"The onus, however, is on Russia and its militant proxies in eastern Ukraine to do theirs. ",claim
"Russia must stop threatening its neighbours, accept the spirit and letter of the Minsk agreements and allow unhindered international monitoring of the Ukrainian- Russian border. ",claim
Russia must disown the separatists and condemn all attempts on the part of the self-proclaimed leaders to create parallel power structures in eastern Ukraine. ,claim
"it must also withdraw its equipment, weapons and troops from Ukrainian territory and seal its borders to the movement of arms and mercenaries into the separatist-held areas. ",claim
A peaceful settlement of the crisis in eastern Ukraine is squarely in Russia's hands. ,claim
"It bears full responsibility for the further escalation of the situation, and for creating another frozen conflict in Europe. ",claim
Attempts to redraw Europe's borders by military force 25 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall are criminal and undermine the very foundations on which the United Nations is built. ,claim
stresses the importance of ensuring their continuing reporting and presence in the conflict-affected area ,claim
"Providing an objective, unbiased alternative narrative is critical ",claim
Russia's propaganda machinery expands its reach. ,premise
"My delegation reiterates its full support to Ukraine's independence, sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity. ",claim
Ukraine's European choice is not an imposition from the outside. ,claim
"It is the choice of the Ukrainian people who a year ago showed clearly that they have had enough of corruption, enough of cronyism, enough of kleptocracy. ",premise
That choice was reaffirmed in the recent national elections and must be respected by all. ,claim
"we believe that inviting international players acting under an OSCE mandate to Security Council meetings is not totally appropriate, not to mention that it distracts them from their direct obligations and unnecessarily politicizes practical activities. ",claim
"The fact that inviting them was for precisely that purpose has been confirmed by the statements we have heard today by several Council members, who have used our platform and the OSCE representatives not to constructively seek a solution to an internal Ukrainian crisis, but rather to make another foray into propaganda, with new flourishes. ",premise
The situation in the Donetsk and Luhansk provinces unquestionably remains tense. ,claim
The ceasefire regime is not being fully complied with ,claim
the withdrawal of heavy weaponry and equipment has not begun ,claim
during the entire period of the ceasefire we have seen Ukrainian forces concentrated along almost all the front lines. ,premise
"that concentration of the Ukrainian forces is taking place very close to the cities of Donbas, which the rebels are forced to protect. ",premise
there have been clashes between the parties along the front lines. ,claim
Innocent civilians are being killed every day ,claim
There is systematic shelling in residential areas of Donetsk near the airport. ,claim
"On 6 November, a mortar shell launched from that neighbourhood in a north-westerly direction - which has been confirmed by the OSCE monitors - fell on a Donetsk sports school soccer field, killing two boys and injuring three. ",premise
Cluster munitions fired from the same position at the beginning of October killed some workers from the International Committee of the Red Cross. ,premise
the strengthened rebel positions the OSCE monitors have seen are in areas that are under constant attack by the armed forces. ,claim
Kyiv's fear of the rebel forces is so great ,premise
in order to justify their failures and the massive deployment ofpeople and equipment to the front ,premise
we are once again hearing loud assertions about Russia sending weapons and members of its regular army. ,claim
In the Western capitals and through NATO they are shouting pronouncements about virtual deployment of convoys and fighters from Russian territory. ,premise
"But no one is presenting any real facts to confirm such assertions, because this is all empty talk and the usual propagandistic lies. ",premise
"the Russia-Ukraine border is subject to particularly careful attention and observation and is easy to monitor, including from space. ",claim
we are discouraged by the almost complete lack of reaction from the OSCE Mission concerning the movements and strengthening of positions of the Ukrainian armed forces and its other armed sub-divisions ,claim
But on 9 November heavy artillery and tanks entered Karlivka ,premise
"on 8 November Grad and Uragan multiple-launch rocket systems and Scud missile launchers arrived in the Luhansk area, and a group of 500 Ukrainian military entered the Krasna Talivka district in the Luhansk region. ",premise
"On 7 November, 32 tanks approached the eastern outskirts of Horlivka, while 13 tanks, 15 Shilka self- guided anti-aircraft guns, 7 Tochka-U tactical missile launch systems, 6 Grad multiple launch rocket systems and a Smerch multiple rocket launcher headed for Artemivsk. ",premise
On 6 November a tank convoy entered the outskirts of Yasynuvata in Donetsk province. ,premise
Those are statistics. ,premise
Why are these facts not being talked about? ,premise
It must be clear to everyone that the lack of information on this in the OSCE report creates a false and provocative picture of what has happened. ,claim
"We believe that the full, thorough compliance of the parties to the conflict with the Minsk agreement is essential. ",claim
he first major issue is establishing a genuine ceasefire that both sides would observe responsibly. ,premise
"No less important, however, are the elements of the agreements concerning the decentralization of authority and establishing an inclusive nationwide dialogue and measures for improving the humanitarian and economic situation in Donbas. ",premise
But the Ukrainian authorities are doing none of those things. ,claim
We are concerned about President Poroshenko's decision to recall the law on a special status for specific areas of Luhansk and Donetsk provinces. ,premise
"After all, that is a cornerstone of the Minsk agreements, which will essentially be made completely null and void. ",premise
the law could have become a basis for further talks between Kyiv and the rebels. ,claim
"Kyiv also failed to implement another important provision of the Minsk agreement, the law granting amnesty to those who have participated in the events. ",claim
it appears that the Chair of the Verkhovna Rada is proposing that it be rescinded. ,premise
No guarantees of personal security for participants in the consultations were provided. ,premise
"we find that instead of taking measures to rebuild Donbas, the Ukrainian Government has established a new order for financing its budgetary institutions and meeting social and pension payments ",premise
they have simply been cancelled ,claim
"we reject any accusations directed at Russia's efforts to send humanitarian convoys carrying food, medicines and building materials to Donetsk and Luhansk. ",claim
such accusations are simply amoral. ,claim
And we have had enough of the fabrications and distortions on this subject. ,claim
"Kyiv is informed about every humanitarian convoy fully and in good time, but getting its cooperation is problematic. ",claim
The Russian Federation respects the will of the people of the south-east as they have expressed it. ,claim
"the elections were conducted in an orderly way and oter turn-out was high, and certainly not forced at gunpoint. ",claim
It is particularly important that the elected representatives received a mandate to resolve the practical issues of restoring normal life in the region. ,premise
They pose no threats to the Minsk agreements and the peace process. ,claim
"they present a unique opportunity for launching a sustainable dialogue between the central Ukrainian authorities and the representatives of Donbas, with the goal of finding comprehensive political solutions that can eliminate the accumulated disagreements. ",claim
there is no alternative to an inclusive dialogue conducted on a mutually respectful and equal basis. ,premise
"It is high time for Kyiv to fulfil the obligations it undertook in Geneva, particularly given that it now has representative partners in the negotiations. ",claim
the situation in eastern Ukraine has now deteriorated much further. ,claim
"As Assistant Secretary-General Toyberg-Frandzen has just told us, the ceasefire is ""under continuous and serious strain"" and Minsk is ""in jeopardy"". ",premise
"Ambassador Tagliavini spoke of the ""blunt disregard for commitments undertaken in Minsk"". ",premise
"We have seen consistent and credible reports of Russian- supplied military reinforcements, including heavy weapons and tanks, moving to the front line of the conflict in eastern Ukraine. ",premise
"The OSCE Chief Monitor, Ambassador Apakan, has just described three separate sightings of such convoys by OSCE monitors. ",premise
"We must all be seriously concerned at these further escalations in eastern Ukraine and at Russia's ongoing violations of the Minsk protocols, particularly its failure to withdraw all its personnel from Ukraine. ",claim
"And, in further violation of the Minsk protocols, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) has been prevented from monitoring adequately the Ukraine/Russia border, where Russian troops appear - once again - to be massing in significant numbers. ",claim
"As Assistant Secretary-General Toyberg- Frandzen has just told us, failure to secure the border is a threat to peace. ",claim
This is all ominously reminiscent of the situation prior to Russia's purported annexation of Crimea. ,premise
We have seen this positioning before. ,claim
These recent developments come against the backdrop of the so-called elections in eastern Ukraine. ,premise
"These illegitimate, pseudo-elections have been widely condemned around the world, including by the Secretary-General. ",claim
"They were another direct contravention of the Minsk protocol, which clearly states that elections must be held ""in accordance with the law of Ukraine"". ",premise
Australia welcomes the legitimate parliamentary elections that were held in Ukraine on 26 October. ,claim
"It is wrong, of course, that people in Crimea and many in the separatist-controlled territories in eastern Ukraine were unable to exercise their democratic right to vote. ",premise
We commend the Ukrainian authorities for their efforts to enfranchise as many people as possible in these very difficult circumstances. ,claim
The Jordanian representative a few moments ago mentioned the risk from the deteriorating security situation to access to the MH-17 crash site. ,premise
I must emphasize that Australia remains determined to do all it can to bring those responsible for the downing of MH-l7 to justice. ,claim
We are committed to making a full international return to the MH-l7 crash site when it is safe to do so and in the company of our Dutch and Malaysian partners. ,claim
"This can, however, happen only if Russian-backed and Russian- armed separatists comply with the ceasefire. ",claim
"More broadly, adherence to the ceasefire and to the commitments made in the Minsk protocol is essential to move to a lasting political solution in Ukraine, which must be based on respect for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. ",claim
"But without a genuine engagement from Russia, this plan will obviously come to nothing. ",claim
Russia's persistent campaign of deliberate destabilization. ,claim
Russia's actions are continuing to fuel the unrest and are undermining the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine. ,claim
"The Russian economy is already paying a heavy price for that action, and any further actions can only inevitably lead to even greater consequences for Russia. ",claim
Russia must withdraw all support to  the separatists; remove all its personnel and assets from Ukraine; and engage in genuine dialogue with Ukraine. ,claim
The OSCE must also be allowed to do its job and monitor unimpeded the Ukraine/Russia border as set out in the Minsk protocol. ,claim
Russia's continued refusal to heed the international community's call to de-escalate the crisis can only lead to Russia's further isolation. ,claim
"I drew the attention of the Council to the dangerously deteriorating security situation in the eastern part of Ukraine, which threatens our territorial integrity and shows a tendency to transform into a ""frozen conflict"", and thus continues to be a challenge to peace and stability in the whole of Europe and beyond. ",claim
Ukraine remains devoted to the settlement of the conflict through diplomatic means. ,claim
"The establishment of a Trilateral Contact Group of senior representatives of Ukraine, the Russian Federation and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Chairman-in-Office is aimed at finding a political and diplomatic solution to the crisis. ",premise
"The Group held several meetings, including those in Minsk, on 5 and 19 September. ",premise
"The agreements reached at those meetings - a protocol and a memorandum dated 5 and 19 September, respectively - were supposed to become an important step towards a sustainable, mutually agreed ceasefire, a secure Russian/Ukrainian border and the return of peace and stability to eastern Ukraine, with the establishment of a special status zone, which is to be empowered with strong local self-government under Ukrainian law. ",premise
"The commitment to the implementation of the agreements was confirmed during the high-level meeting held in Milan on 17 October, in which the President of the Russian Federation participated. ",premise
"Despite their claims, the separatists and the Russian Federation, as their sponsor, continue to commit gross violations of the Minsk agreements. ",claim
"The first point is that we agreed in Minsk on an immediate bilateral ceasefire and the withdrawal of illegal armed groups, military equipment and fighters and mercenaries from the territory of Ukraine. ",premise
"In breach of all of the agreements, militants backed by Russian regular forces continue to shell the Ukrainian military as well as civilian locations, in particular using Grad and Smerch systems. ",premise
"Since 5 September, Ukrainian forces and civilians have been shelled over 2,800 times. ",premise
A total of 131 Ukrainian servicemen have been killed and more than 568 have been wounded. ,premise
At least 65 civilians lost their lives. ,premise
"Militants inspired by Russia are disregarding efforts to set up the touchline and continue to conduct offensive operations, trying to expand the area under their control. ",premise
"The large-scale recruitment and training of militants is taking place in the area of Donbas, which is temporarily out of Ukrainian Government control, as well as on the Russian side of the border. ",premise
"Another clear indication of violation of the Minsk agreements is the large amount of heavy weaponry, along with personnel and fuel, that after 5 September illegally entered Ukraine from Russian territory. ",premise
A dangerous shipment of illegal armament supplies from Russia to militants was observed by Ukraine and the OSCE in the past few days. ,premise
"On 6 November, Ukrainian authorities detected the large-scale movement of heavy weaponry from Russian territory to the town of Krasny Luch in Ukraine: two columns, including 32 tanks, 16 howitzers and 30 Kamaz trucks, with soldiers and ammunition. ",premise
The OSCE confirmed on 8 November the movement of two columns of 50 fully loaded trucks. ,premise
Almost every truck had an artillery mount in tow. ,premise
"On 9 November, the OSCE recorded a convoy of 17 trucks 15 kilometres to the east of Donetsk. ",premise
Five trucks transported Grad systems. ,premise
"On 10 November, the OSCE spotted another convoy of 17 trucks that supplied the terrorists with 122-millimetre howitzers and radio-location stations. ",premise
"On the same day, a second convoy of trucks, three of which carried radio-location stations, illegally crossed the border. ",premise
"Yesterday, the OSCE recorded a convoy of 43 trucks in the eastern part of Donetsk. ",premise
Five of these trucks carried 122-millimetre howitzers and five others carried Grads. ,premise
A Pantsir-l anti-aircraft missile and gun system was spotted in the vicinity of the militants' checkpoint near the town of Novoazovsk. ,premise
Illegal Russian convoys with heavy weapons are reported literally every day. ,premise
The Russian delegation insisted today that its Government does not provide any military assistance to the separatists in Ukraine. ,premise
"This means that someone else besides the State has missiles, tanks and guns, and is supplying them to the illegal armed groups in Ukraine. ",claim
It means that somebody else in Russia has attack aircraft and helicopters that are continually violating our State air border. ,claim
The Russian delegation keeps saying that the Russian armed forces and military equipment have never crossed the borders of Ukraine. ,premise
"Does this mean that it is not the Russian Federation's border guard that controls its side of the Ukraine-Russia border, but someone else who is permitting the illegal crossing of military convoys? ",claim
Ukraine is surrounded by a huge amount of armaments and troops. ,claim
"We demand that Russia explain here and now why it needs to maintain 200 tanks, 1,600 vehicles, 640 artillery units, 191 attack aircraft and 121 attack helicopters on our borders. ",claim
"The illegal movement of cargo from the territory of the Russian Federation through the State border, which the Russian delegation today characterized as humanitarian aid, to the civilians of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, is also a matter of deep concern to Ukraine. ",claim
"It was organized without seeking the official consent of the Ukrainian side, without completing the necessary border and customs procedures by the relevant Ukrainian authorities, and without coordinating with the International Committee of the Red Cross for its representatives to accompany the cargo, in breach of the national legislation of Ukraine and the agreements reached earlier. ",premise
The latest so-called humanitarian convoys crossed the State border of Ukraine on 31 October and 2 and 4 November. ,premise
"We demand that the Russian Federation stop using the issue of humanitarian aid as a cover for delivering illegal supplies of troops, mercenaries and weapons to eastern Ukraine. ",claim
"Contrary to these hostile actions and Russian propaganda myths, Ukrainian forces are observing the ceasefire regime. ",claim
They make every effort to avoid full-scale military actions and use weapons only to defend themselves against militants' attacks. ,premise
Let me say very clearly that the only reason why open war has not started yet in the east of Ukraine is because of Ukraine's restraint. ,claim
"We remain committed to a peaceful settlement and the Minsk arrangements, and urge Russia to do the same. ",claim
Ukraine has rendered all necessary assistance to the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission in Ukraine to effectively implement its mandate. ,claim
"Russian-supported militants have not extended security guarantees to OSCE personnel in all areas that they control, and obstruct the Mission's monitoring activities. ",claim
"Moreover, in order to hide its violations, the Russian military uses cutting-edge electronic technology to jam OSCE drones, thereby disturbing monitoring efforts in the region in spite of the Minsk agreements. ",premise
The Russian side has also refused tojoin the consensus on the proposed expansion of the mandate of the existing OSCE observation mission at two Russian border checkpoints to all Russian checkpoints along the 400-kilometre section of the border in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. ,premise
"With the Mission's mandate set to expire on 23 November, we urge the Russian side to demonstrate a clear commitment to the peaceful resolution of the crisis in the eastern Ukraine by agreeing to allow OSCE observers to conduct their monitoring activities at all border crossings with Ukraine and along the entire length of the border in the area. ",premise
Why is there such a stark difference in the approaches adopted by Ukraine and Russia to the role that the OSCE monitors can play in the current situation? ,premise
Ukraine is open to transparent monitoring and control. ,claim
Russia and its puppets are not. ,claim
We agreed in Minsk to adopt the Ukrainian law on provisional arrangements for local government in some areas of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts - the law on special status - and to ensure within the provisions of that law early local elections in some areas of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. ,premise
The new law was adopted by the Ukrainian Parliament on 16 September. ,premise
"According to that law, local elections in some areas of Donetsk and Luhansk regions were scheduled for 7 December and were intended to produce legitimate local self- governance that would make proper use of enhanced powers, engage in an inclusive national dialogue and ensure the reconstruction of Donbas, which has been severely damaged by the military activities of illegal armed groups. ",premise
Ukraine rejects any rumours about alleged additional agreements on this issue. ,claim
"What was agreed was signed and what was signed was published, including the OSCE press releases. ",premise
These so-called elections were conducted in violation of Ukrainian legislation and international standards and contrary to the third and ninth articles of the Minsk protocol. ,claim
By opting to recognize the illegal and illegitimate so-called elections in certain areas of Donbas ,premise
Russia has chosen time and again to violate the norms of international law and fundamental OSCE principles and commitments. ,claim
It has chosen to act in breach of the Minsk agreements. ,claim
We are very concerned by the approach of the Russian Federation that consists in manipulating peoples' right to self-determination. ,premise
"Once again, it has, as we saw in Crimea, only one priority - to feed separatism and create frozen conflicts in sovereign States that Russia treats as zones of national interest. ",claim
"That is why neither Ukraine nor the international community will ever recognize the illegal referendum in Crimea or the illegal pseudo-elections in certain areas of the Donetsk and Lugansk regions, whatever their outcomes. ",claim
"Illegal elections and continuous violations of the ceasefire regime by militants, as well as a sharp increase in the illegal supply of weapons and military equipment across the border by the Russian Federation, have seriously undermined the Minsk process towards a peaceful settlement. ",claim
They undermine any trust placed in signatories who fail to keep their word. ,claim
"Kyiv has confirmed its commitment to continuing to observe the ceasefire regime in line with the Minsk agreements, and called on all involved in the process to swiftly resume settlement efforts. ",claim
We are seeking to make use of all possible mechanisms to forge a peaceful solution to the situation. ,claim
"We call on Russia, the European Union and the United States to meet together in the Geneva format in order to send a clear and consolidated message as well as strong impetus to the parties concerned to strictly adhere to the letter and spirit of the Minsk agreements. ",claim
we will not yield to Russia's attempts to compel implicit international recognition of the ring leaders of illegal entities in the Donbas by inviting them to this meeting. ,claim
We continue to demand that the Russian Federation stop backing illegal armed groups; immediately and strictly comply with the Minsk agreements by withdrawing its military forces and weaponry from the territory of Ukraine; establish joint customs and border control; release all Ukrainian hostages captured by Russian forces and their proxies; and stop its protracted military exercise in close vicinity to our borders. ,claim
We continue to call on the Council to finally assume its Charter responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security in order to put an end to the Russian aggression against Ukraine. ,claim
"First, I have said, and I repeat, that of course the ceasefire and the normalization of the situation are the key tasks, but they require trust. ",claim
"When we heard the statements of Ukraine's representatives in late October, early November and more recently, we were convinced that Kyiv was not committed to a diplomatic solution to the conflict. ",premise
"From the very beginning, the Kyiv authorities have made no secret of the fact that the ceasefire would be used for a realignment of forces and the pursuit of military activities. ",premise
"He said:  ""The ceasefire and the achievement of peace are going to work in our favour. ",premise
All four tank factories are working three shifts. ,premise
Several hundred armed vehicles have been fully rebuilt and have entered the anti-terrorist operation area. ,premise
"We need the ceasefire regime to receive high-tech equipment and military and financing assistance from the West."" ",premise
"Markiyan Lubkivsky, an adviser to the head of the Security Service of Ukraine, also said on the national radio, on 2 November and again on 7 November:  ""Sooner or later, we are going to have to engage in very proactive activities"" and that ""we will need three or four years to resolve the situation. ",premise
We think we could win this war based on the Croatian scenario. ,premise
"In 1991, Croatia began the war and it ended in 1995 as a result of successful special operations."" ",premise
"As we can see, there is not a single word about the implementation ofthe Minsk agreement here, just about a victory on the battlefield. ",claim
"Secondly, of course some activities do not help the situation from the Ukrainian perspective. ",claim
"For example, with respect to the serious matter of the delimitation of territory, an agreement had been almost 80 per cent concluded. ",premise
"Then suddenly on 28 October, the Ukrainian representative General Dumansky, without offering any reasons, annulled an accord in which over 80 per cent of the lines of opposing forces had been delimited. ",premise
"Those are horrific numbers; they are very striking, even to me. ",premise
I am ready to respond to that question in a more specific manner. ,claim
It will be agreed that the equipment and the Russian armed forces are on the territory of my country and are not threatening Ukraine. ,claim
They are not leaving my country. ,claim
"Thus, inciting such emotions in the Security Council, as if there were going to be such huge attack on Ukraine, does not help the constructive discussions that all here are counselling and that we too endorse. ",claim
"Why, despite the promises, are huge amounts of armaments and personnel - around 49,000 people - still positioned along the Ukrainian border? ",premise
This is about trust. ,claim
What are the troops doing? ,premise
"They have been carrying out exercises since February or March, without explanation. ",premise
That is about trust. ,claim
Both Russia and the Russian-sponsored illegal militants persist in interpreting the ceasefire in their own twisted way: Ukraine must cease while the militants can continue to fire. ,premise
I believe that no one in this Chamber has any doubt that a country under attack would do its utmost to protect itself. ,claim
"In the face of aggression, it is the inherent right of each and every State to defend its land and its people. ",premise
"That is exactly what Ukraine is doing - defending itself in the face of the ongoing attacks against its unity, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. ",claim
"Time and again in recent months, its leadership has sought to salvage the ceasefire with new proposals, new deadlines and new periods of silence. ",claim
"The militants, however, have benefited from Ukraine's restraint by regrouping, rearming and grabbing more land. ",claim
"Since the start of the ceasefire, the militants have captured an extra 550 square kilometres of Ukrainian territory between Donetsk and Mariupol and, according to their commanders, have no intention of stopping. ",premise
"In spite of the many calls of the international community to close its borders to the illegal flows of arms and foreign fighters, Russia's borders remain wide open to the flow of deadly weaponry and soldiers of fortune. ",premise
"Here is a typical excerpt from the 16 January report of the smm of the Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE):  ""The SMM. saw three unmarked trucks towing three D-3O 122-mm howitzers on the southern edge of Donetsk city, travelling west past a 'DPR'-controlled checkpoint. ",premise
"Two unmarked T-80 battle tanks were seen by the SMM. travelling south-east in Makiivka The SMM. observed a convoy of 21 military-style Ural and KAMAZ trucks, also unmarked, heading south on a highway near Starobesheve Four of the trucks carried what appeared to be communication equipment, while the remaining trucks were covered."" ",premise
"In the weekly update for the period of 15-21 January, the OSCE observer mission at Gukovo and Donetsk noted:  ""The OM. continued to observe a number ofpersons in military-style clothing crossing the border in both directions... ",premise
"During the reporting period, the Obersvation Teams observed 396 men and women in military-style dress crossing the border in both directions... ",premise
"Ninety-three percent of border crossings occurred at the Donetsk BCP."" ",premise
The little that can be gleaned from the two kilometres where the OSCE observer mission is active is clearly indicative of what is happening away from the eyes of the observers ,premise
It is no wonder that Russia keeps blocking all attempts to expand the OSCE border observer mission to cover more ground. ,premise
"The Ukrainian sources estimate that as of 15 January, the separatists had 542 tanks, 990 armoured personnel carriers, nearly 700 artillery systems, some 70 Grad rockets and 57 air defence systems. ",premise
"How on Earth, but for Russia's continued supply, could a ragtag bunch of illegal militants obtain such an impressive arsenal of sophisticated heavy weaponry and arms, which by now could well rival the arsenals of the smaller European States? ",premise
"And where on Earth, but for Russia's continued support, could a ragtag bunch of militants get the millions needed to buy all that heavy weaponry and machinery, especially in an area where the local inhabitants are said to be starving and local hospitals cannot even buy bread for their patients? ",premise
"The war in eastern Ukraine is not a civil war, as some try to portray it, but a calculated and systematic attempt to destabilize Ukraine - a foreign-sponsored war. ",claim
"Backed by sophisticated weaponry including Grad rockets, artillery systems, modern tanks, armoured personnel carriers, and an influx of foreign mercenaries, the militants continue their barrage of deadly attacks. ",premise
"The past few weeks in particular have seen a disturbing increase in ceasefire violations, including a massive onslaught by the militants on the Donetsk airport. ",premise
"Yesterday again, intensive fighting was reported in several locations, including north-west of Luhansk, where militants destroyed, with massive artillery fire, and occupied one of the checkpoints of the Ukrainian military. ",premise
Growing evidence points to a systematic use by the militants of residential areas as a cover for launching Grad rockets and shelling the Ukrainian forces. ,premise
"Overall, since the announcement of the ceasefire on 5 September 2014, Ukrainian forces and civilians have been shelled more than 5,660 times, some 1,500 Ukrainian military have been killed and wounded, and at least 151 civilians have been killed. ",premise
"We must ensure that perpetrators of this reprehensible act, and all the countless acts of violence and gross violations of human rights, especially around the areas held by the illegal separatist groups, are brought to account. ",claim
While every defensive move by Ukraine is blasted by the Russian propaganda as ceasefire violations ,claim
Russia has never even once condemned or disowned the illegal and lawless separatist militants. ,claim
Russia's intentions to rewrite the Minsk agreements in a way that would legitimize and accept the territorial gains achieved by the militants ,premise
the Kremlin's wholehearted support for those criminals. ,claim
Lithuania rejects all calls to renegotiate the terms ofthe ceasefire. ,claim
The agreed parameters of the ceasefire already exist and must be respected. ,claim
"We urge all sides, in particular Russia, to engage and fully implement the Minsk agreements in their entirety and without any further delay. ",claim
"IfRussia is genuinely interested in putting an end to the devastating violence and deaths in eastern Ukraine, including the deaths of its own nameless soldiers sent to wage a war against a brotherly nation, ",premise
"it must stop destabilizing Ukraine, stop military supplies to its proxies, stop the illegal separatist groups and withdraw all military equipment. ",claim
The Ukrainian- Russian State border must be secured. ,claim
Continuous monitoring by the OSCE must be ensured. ,claim
"All hostages and illegally detained persons must be released, including the Ukrainian pilot Nadiya Savchenko, who was kidnapped and is being held illegally in Russia. ",claim
"International observers, including the United Nations and OSCE monitoring missions, must be allowed full and unconditional access throughout Ukraine's territory, including Crimea. ",claim
"International monitors' full, unobstructed access to Crimea remains particularly important in the light of the continuous deterioration of the situation of the indigenous Tatar community since the annexation by Russia of the region. ",premise
"My delegation firmly supports Ukraine's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity and will not recognize the illegal annexation of Crimea. ",claim
We urge the Minsk signatories to spare no effort in seeking a peaceful solution to the crisis. ,claim
"We urge Russia in particular to embrace the fundamental principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and put an end to its destabilizing, expansionist and revanchist policies in the region, including Ukraine, Moldova and the South Caucasus, where, contrary, to Russia's commitments under the 2008 August and September agreements, it is pursuing the annexation of Georgia's Abkhaz and Tskhinvali regions under the guise of the so-called treaties on alliance and strategic partnerships. ",claim
"We keep meeting on Ukraine because, despite countless commitments made to the international community to de-escalate - here in the Council and in Geneva, Minsk, Berlin, Normandy and elsewhere ",premise
Russia continues to choose a path of escalation and obfuscation. ,claim
"In addition to occupying Crimea, Russia continues to train, equip and fight alongside separatists in eastern Ukraine. ",premise
"Indeed, Russia has so consistently broken its commitments and violated its obligations not to lop off part of another country that some in the Council may begin to accept Russia's behaviour as an unfortunate but inevitable reality, a new normal that would be dangerous for Ukraine and dangerous for international peace and security, because complacency would reward aggression and threaten the basic rules on which our collective security rests. ",premise
The current situation is dangerous. ,claim
"It is dangerous because Russia continues to train and equip separatists with heavy weapons and to fight by their side, in flagrant violation of the September Minsk agreement, Ukrainian sovereignty and international law. ",premise
"the separatists trained, supplied and supported by  Russia are launching a full-scale attack on the strategic city of Debaltseve, inside Ukrainian-controlled territory, in blatant violation of the 19 September Minsk ceasefire lines, in an attemp to gain control of a significant rail juncture. ",claim
"The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) reported yesterday that at least 30 Grad rockets had hit the city on 19 January, killing 3 civilians and wounding 12 ",premise
The OSCE confirmed that those rockets had come from the direction of the separatist-controlled city of Horlivka. ,premise
"Yesterday, independent media reported that separatists had blown up a rail bridge connecting the port city of Mariupol to the rest of Ukraine. ",premise
These moves appear calculated and strategic in nature. ,claim
"Since President Poroshenko announced the unilateral silence regime on 9 December, which brought about a brief respite from the violence, separatists and the Russians who backed them have carried out more than 1,000 attacks against Ukrainian positions. ",premise
Since late December Russia has transferred at least 100 additional pieces of Russian military equipment and materiel to separatists. ,premise
"These latest transfers come atop previous transfers of hundreds of pieces of Russian military equipment to separatists since September, including tanks, armoured personnel carriers, heavy artillery pieces and other military vehicles. ",premise
"Yet from those two checkpoints alone, monitors note hundreds of individuals in military-style dress freely crossing the border every week. ",premise
"The separatists have a larger fighting force, with more weaponry than some European countries. ",claim
Russia is reportedly preparing to deliver its twelfth resupply convoy to separatists in Ukrainian territory at the end of the month. ,claim
"separatists continue to harass, threaten and intimidate the impartial monitors deployed by the OSCE, - monitors who serve on behalf of the international community ",premise
"According to a 14 January OSCE Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) to Ukraine report, the SMM. was stopped at a separatist checkpoint in Oktyabr by a hostile separatist commander who ordered the team's car searched and said the monitors would be shot if a camera was found, even though cameras are a basic tool of documentation work. ",premise
"Separatist guards kept their guns pointed at the monitors during the exchange, the monitors said, even though the team posed no threat and, mercifully, had no camera. ",premise
It is dangerous because Russia continues to break commitments it has made to the escalades. ,premise
"Ukraine and the international community have launched several serious efforts to seek a peaceful resolution to the conflict, including through the trilateral contact Group on Ukraine, the Minsk agreement, the Normandy group and other negotiating forums. ",premise
We continue to believe that there can be no military solution and that political negotiations are key. ,claim
"Yet, time and again, Russia's words promise peace while Russia's actions make war. ",claim
"Time and again, President Putin has extended an olive branch in one hand while passing out Grad missiles and tanks with the other. ",claim
The current situation is dangerous ,claim
It is dangerous because Russia's actions are directly contributing to a humanitarian crisis. ,premise
"With each passing day, more civilians are killed and maimed. ",premise
"Many of us have seen the ghastly images of the 13 January attack on a passenger bus, which was struck while waiting at a Ukrainian security checkpoint at Volnovakha. ",premise
"Indelible images of the blood-soaked snow alongside the bus, of its blown-out windows and the gapping holes left in its seats and curtains, of the gory steps to the back entrance of the bus - these images are unforgettable. ",premise
Thirteen civilians were killed in that attack and at least 16 more people were wounded. ,premise
The conclusion of the impartial OSCE monitoring mission is that the craters at the crime scene were caused by rockets fired from the north-north-east direction from the checkpoint. ,premise
"That area is controlled by Russian-backed separatists, and multiple open- source reports have shown separatists firing Grad rockets from the territory to the north-north-east of Volnovakha. ",claim
"The same day the bus was struck, the SMM reported hearing Grad rockets fired from several other separatist-controlled areas. ",premise
"At first, separatists bragged on social media about the strike on the Ukrainian security checkpoint. ",premise
Vut the postings disappeared after it was reported that a busload of civilians had been hit. ,premise
"For every attack on civilians that makes headlines, there are dozens more, no less deadly, that go unreported. ",premise
"Since the conflict began, more than 10,000 people have been injured in the conflict. ",premise
"Nearly 5,000 people have been killed, approximately 800 of them since November when the Council last met to discuss the Ukraine crisis (see S/PV.7311). ",premise
One of the attacks that did not make news occurred on 11 January. ,premise
"According to the SMM, mortars struck two houses in the Government- held town of Hranitne, wounding a girl. ",premise
She died of her injuries before she reached the hospital - she was three years old. ,premise
Those are some of the reasons why the Russians' most recent efforts to blame Ukraine ring so hollow. ,claim
"On Thursday, President Putin issued a last-minute invitation to President Poroshenko to discuss a new Russian-conceived so-called peace plan - a plan that would free Russia from the commitment it made in Minsk to withdraw its fighters and return control over the international border to Ukraine. ",premise
"The plan would seek to legitimize territorial gains made by separatists since September, as well as Russian personnel and military equipment on the territory of Ukraine. ",premise
"We have seen peace plans like that before in Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Transnistria. ",premise
"When President Poroshenko did not accept Putin's offer, Russia immediately launched a diplomatic and media blitz, claiming it was proof that Ukraine was not interested in peace. ",premise
Let us pull the veil away from Putin's peace plan and call it for what it is: a Russian occupation plan. ,claim
"If Russia is serious about peace, it should follow through on Minsk, to which it had agreed more than four months ago. ",claim
"If Russia wants to end the conflict, the steps they must take are the same as they were on 5 September 2014 ",premise
remove all military equipment and personnel from Ukraine ,premise
stop backing the separatists ,premise
"allow unimpeded OSCE monitoring; return control of Ukraine's international border to the Ukrainian Government and release all hostages, including those being held in Russia, such as Ukrainian pilot Nadiya Savchenko. ",premise
Yet Russia has taken none of the steps set out in Minsk. ,premise
"In contrast to Russia, Ukraine has consistently taken steps to de-escalate the crisis, demonstrating measurable progress on several key commitments made in Minsk and passing key reforms to reduce corruption and grant greater authority to its regions. ",premise
"Poroshenko announced unilateral ceasefires on the part of Ukrainian forces, resulting in brief but significant decreases in violence. ",premise
Yet peace cannot be made unilaterally. ,claim
"Of course, the Ukrainian Government must abide by international norms, even as it defends its land and its people. ",claim
"All sides should take every feasible precaution to prevent any loss of civilian life, including by indiscriminate shelling of civilian areas. ",claim
There is a broader reason it would be dangerous to accept Russia's actions as the new normal. ,claim
We have seen this playbook before. ,premise
"Before eastern Ukraine we saw it in Crimea, and before Crimea we saw it in the Georgian regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, and before that in Georgia and Transnistria ",premise
The end-game in all ofthose Moscow-manufactured crises has been identical: to gobble up parts of neighbouring countries and to create frozen conflicts. ,premise
And Russia is consistently working to put those frozen conflicts under a deeper freeze. ,claim
"In recent weeks, for example, at the same time that Russia was flouting its Minsk agreements, President Putin was putting the finishing touches on another set of agreements, the so-called ""treaties of alliance"", with de facto authorities in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. ",premise
Those treaties will compound years of violations of Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity. ,claim
Instability is frozen. ,claim
Violations of sovereignty are frozen. ,claim
Militarization is frozen. ,claim
"In sum, all of the problems that the United Nations, and the Security Council in particular, were created to address, are frozen. ",claim
"If Russia succeeds in achieving its aims, if we allow this behaviour to become the new normal, this will not be the last time Russia uses this well-worn playbook. ",claim
The Russian Federation is ensuring full compliance with the Minsk accords to settle the Ukrainian crisis. ,claim
"We take that into account during contacts with the sides, including the leadership of Ukraine and the rebels and representatives of interested foreign countries, including under the Normandy format. ",premise
Kyiv botched the 16 January meeting of the Minsk contact group ,claim
the Ukrainian representatives did not show up at the Belarusian capital. ,premise
"The situation on the ground has recently worsened significantly, with the Donetsk airport becoming the epicentre of clashes. ",claim
"the airport was to have been given to the militias, the matter has not been resolved peacefully because of disputes in other areas of the engagement line. ",premise
"Ukrainian armed forces have continued to shell Donetsk and other populated areas, leading to a large number of civilian casualties. ",claim
The current escalation of the situation in Donbas is hardly fortuitous. ,claim
"Over the entire time of the ceasefire, the Ukrainian side violated the Minsk agreements ",claim
"by stepping up its military presence in the south-east of the country, there was a strengthening of militarization and regrouping, as well as new waves of mobilization appeals from Kyiv to avenge the defeats of 2014. ",premise
"It is clear that the events of recent days are yet another attempt by Kyiv to resolve the internal political conflict militarily, which will definitely lead to exacerbating the crisis of the State of Ukraine and numerous civilian casualties. ",claim
"Ultimately, it is fraught with catastrophe. ",claim
Kyiv has cast aside all instruments concerning a political settlement of the internal crisis. ,claim
The 21 February agreement signed by Yanukovych and the opposition on the establishment of a Government of national unity had become a dead letter by the next day. ,premise
"The Geneva statement of 17 April, providing for swift and comprehensive constitutional reform involving all regions and political forces, was ignored. ",premise
The road map of the Chairman of the OSCE was rejected. ,premise
The first thing that the forces that came to power after the coup in Kyiv did was to forge ahead with decisions aimed at restricting the rights of linguistic minorities and suffocating dissidents. ,premise
"Despite the fact that half of the country speaks in Russian, almost all Russian-language media were closed down, Russian television broadcasts were forbidden and the political forces representing the Russian citizens in south- east Ukraine were intimidated or simply banned. ",premise
"The south-east and south saw horrific crimes be committed, which have not yet been brought to light or seriously investigated. ",claim
"On 2 May in Odessa, dozens ofpeople were burned alive in the House of Trade Unions building. ",premise
"On 9 May, Victory Day in the Great Patriotic War, in Mariupol, civilians were shot. ",premise
And at the beginning of in July there were again airstrikes in Luhansk. ,premise
The nature and dynamics of the crisis in Ukraine are difficult to understand without an understanding of the ideological undercurrents. ,claim
"Last year, 14 October was declared a public holiday in Ukraine - the day of the establishment of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army - which fought on the side of the Nazis. ",premise
"That is an all-out glorification of Ukrainian Nazi collaborators and misanthropes Bandera and Shukhevych, who have the blood of tens of thousands of Soviet and Polish citizens on their hands. ",premise
"Bandera gave indiscriminate orders to execute his opponents on a massive scale, in particular on grounds of nationality. ",premise
"Let me recall Bandera's words: ""I will kill every Pole from 16 to 60 years of age"". ",premise
"Shukhevych so instructed his followers:  ""Do not bully; destroy! ",premise
Fear not that people will curse us for cruelty. ,premise
"If only half of the Ukrainian population of 40 million remains, there is nothing wrong with that!"" ",premise
"Now incendiary marches, in the style of the Waffen-SS, with portraits of the so-called ""heroes of Ukraine"" are held completely openly, with the approval of the Kyiv authorities. ",premise
"Honestly, the Ukrainian people deserve better heroes. ",claim
"However, speaking on German television, Prime Minister Yatsenyuk lamented the fact that during the Second World War ""the Soviet Union invaded Ukraine and Germany"". ",premise
"Apparently, he would like Ukraine to remain under Nazi occupation even today. ",claim
"Still, enlightened Europe kept silent on the matter. ",premise
"Indeed, it is very strange that those who claim to be civilized can tolerate such a subversive ideology. ",claim
"This is the ideology guiding Kyiv's so-called ""anti-terrorist"" operations, which are, in reality, punitive operations. ",claim
"Aircraft, heavy weaponry, artillery, banned cluster and phosphorus munitions, tactical missiles and multiple rocket launchers are being used against cities in the south- east. ",premise
"The confirmed death toll is approaching 5,000. ",premise
Refugees and internally displaced persons number in the millions. ,premise
"In the city of Donetsk alone, more than  1,000 houses have been destroyed. ",premise
Many small towns and other inhabited areas have been totally destroyed. ,premise
"There have been strikes against residential areas and infrastructure, with total disregard for international humanitarian law and basic moral decency. ",premise
"Even major western non-governmental organizations, which hardly sympathize with the militia, say that the Ukrainian security forces do not distinguish between military and civilian targets. ",premise
"Kyiv reacted immediately to a terrible incident that occurred on 13 January involving a passenger bus in Volnovakha, leveling charges at the militias without any investigation or trial. ",premise
"However, according to the conclusion of the OSCE Mission, the firing came from the north-north-east direction, which is an area where it is dubious rebels could be. ",premise
The Ukrainian Government is using this tragedy to the full extent so as to incite militaristic hysteria. ,claim
"The very next day, the Ukrainian brass stepped up artillery and bomb strikes against the cities of Donbas, resulting in the deaths of dozens of civilians, including women, children and the elderly. ",premise
"A bus stop was hit yesterday, resulting in two deaths and 11 serious injuries. ",premise
"A Russian television station on the ground said that today in Donetsk eight civilians had been killed and 30 wounded, including children ",premise
"Meanwhile, a Ukrainian newspaper reported that today five civilians had been killed and 29 wounded. ",premise
The websites of Ukrainian militias say basically the same thing. ,premise
"In the city of Stakhanaov, Luhansk district, up to 10 citizens were killed today as a result of salvoes from multiple rocket launchers. ",premise
"However, no one in Kyiv is conducting funeral marches. ",claim
It would seem that the fallen are going unnoticed. ,claim
"A significant military force in the south-east is made up of the so-called ""volunteer battalions"", which are funded by Ukrainian oligarchs and answer to no one. ",premise
Some of them openly use Nazi symbols. ,premise
"The Kyiv authorities, while constantly referring to the unity and territorial integrity of the country, have not taken a single step towards genuine national dialogue or constitutional reform with the participation of all groups and regions. ",claim
"Moreover, Kyiv is doing everything to cut off the south-east in practical terms. ",claim
"A decision has been made to withdraw all State institutions and terminate payments from the budget, including welfare and pensions. ",premise
The movement of persons and goods is limited along the lines of engagement. ,premise
"Since 12 January, transportation between Ukraine and Luhansk has been at a standstill. ",premise
The humanitarian situation is catastrophic. ,claim
"Some members of the Security Council, unfortunately, did not heed our call. ",claim
"They hushed up the topic, waxed poetic and squabbled about the number of victims required to qualify the situation as a ""humanitarian crisis"". ",premise
Today there is no room for demagoguery. ,premise
"United Nations humanitarian actors view the situation as a full-scale crisis calling for a presence on the ground, clusters for the delivery of humanitarian assistance and financing humanitarian appeals. ",claim
"Russia is providing significant humanitarian assistance to Donbas, in spite of the controversy that some members of the Council have attempted to raise in this regard. ",claim
"At the same time, we continue to seek agreement with Kyiv, in spite of its obstruction, on the conditions for the provision of such supplies. ",claim
We give timely information regarding sending humanitarian convoys and cargo. ,premise
Aid is also going through various channels. ,premise
Russia has just decided to contribute $5 million to the World Food Programme's humanitarian assistance to the people of Ukraine ,premise
There is a need for the swift resumption of practical work with the contact group for their full implementation. ,claim
"For our part, we are doing out utmost to ensure that the next meeting in Minsk will take place as soon as possible. ",claim
We urge all responsible members of the international community to put pressure on the Ukrainian authorities to move away from confrontation and bring to an end its policy on the forced suppression of the south-east. ,claim
"They must understand that the most pressing need now is to launch direct Ukraine-wide dialogue to discuss the constitutional makeup of the country, which should be comfortable and safe for all citizens without exception ",claim
We have heeded his warning regarding the deterioration of the security situation in Donbas over the past few days. ,premise
"Fighting has resumed with an intensity that we had not seen in Ukraine for several months, especially around what remains of the Donetsk airport. ",premise
What is urgently needed now is to achieve a de-escalation in order to put the political dialogue back on track. ,claim
"The parties must understand that there can be no military solution to the conflict, ",claim
"which has already claimed over 5,000 lives and which entails significant costs for Ukraine, Russia and the European Union. ",premise
"Only the full implementation, in good faith, of the Minsk agreements by all parties will provide a way out of the crisis. ",claim
Every effort must be made to achieve that goal. ,claim
"France remains fully mobilized with a View to achieving a peaceful and lasting settlement of the conflict, and in that context supports all international initiatives that share that goal. ",claim
"Our objectives, as recently recalled by the French President, are clear and consistent: respect for the ceasefire ",claim
the withdrawal of heavy weapons from the contact line ,claim
the settlement of humanitarian issues ,claim
"eventually, the election of new representatives in eastern Ukraine. ",claim
"Yesterday, the Permanent Council of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, in which Russia and Ukraine are represented, adopted a political statement calling for a de-escalation and the full implementation of the Minsk agreements. ",premise
"But beyond mere words, and above all, we now need concrete and verifiable action. ",claim
"The Security Council, which last year dealt with the Ukrainian crisis on more than 30 occasions, should support those efforts and participate in the search for a lasting solution. ",claim
The risk of the crisis spreading within Ukraine and beyond should not be underestimated. ,premise
Ukraine must therefore remain at the heart of the Security Council's priorities. ,claim
Nothing can undermine the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine within its international borders. ,claim
"The situation is now, paradoxically, clearer than it was a few months ago. ",claim
"The parameters necessary for an end to the crisis are now known to all - namely, the Minsk agreements. ",claim
"Against all odds, and despite alternating periods of violence - as we see now - and quiet, that road map was upheld until last week. ",premise
It is not challenged by the parties. ,premise
Its implementation remains very difficult. ,premise
The discussions in the contact group are too slow and only lead to modest results. ,premise
That is due to the significant distrust that prevails between the Russian and Ukrainian parties. ,premise
That state of affairs must be overcome ,claim
we must encourage each party to have the courage to get involved. ,claim
there is now a mechanism for validation and political impetus: the Normandy format. ,claim
It seeks to encourage parties to go further and takes note of the progress made. ,premise
"However, much remains to be done, as the situation on the ground today makes tragically clear. ",premise
We must move forward if we want diplomatic dynamics to prevail over violence and chaos. ,claim
It seems clear to us that Russia is reluctant to engage openly and lastingly to normalize the situation. ,claim
The recent violence is further evidence of Russia's capacity to fuel tensions even as a diplomatic process begins. ,premise
We also call on Ukraine to launch a process leading to institutional reforms giving Donbas greater autonomy while respecting the sovereignty of Ukraine. ,claim
We call once again on Russia to stop the transfer of arms and individuals across the Russian-Ukrainian border. ,claim
We call on Russia to bring all of its influence to bear on the separatists to ensure that the ceasefire is fully upheld. ,claim
Securing the Russian-Ukrainian border remains vital to emerging from the crisis. ,claim
"Convoys coming from Ukraine, the European Union and, of course, Russia must all be deployed in accordance with Ukrainian law. ",claim
Our policy is based on firmness and openness to dialogue. ,premise
The worrying surge in violence over the past week underlines the grave threat that the situation in eastern Ukraine continues to pose to international peace and security. ,claim
We were all shocked at the deaths of at least 12 civilians in Volnovakha earlier this month and by reports of hospitals being shelled in Donetsk. ,premise
We have seen yet more reports of Russian personnel and equipment crossing the Ukrainian border. ,premise
"Among this, we have heard the usual pattern of Russian denials and misinformation. ",premise
"It is clear, just as it was when we last met, in November (see S/PV.73ll), that Russia's actions continue to undermine Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, violating international norms and flouting the principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter. ",claim
Over 1 million people have been displaced from their homes. ,premise
"As winter deepens, the situation will only get worse, with the elderly, the young and the infirm all increasingly vulnerable. ",premise
The separatists must allow Ukrainian humanitarian convoys to enter the regions they control ,claim
Russia must stop using its unilateral humanitarian convoys as cover to supply those separatists with arms. ,claim
"The human rights situation gives equal cause for concern, with human rights violations reported in the illegally annexed Crimean peninsula and a total breakdown in law and order in areas under separatist control. ",claim
it should dismay us all that repeated calls for a ceasefire and for respect for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity have not been heeded. ,claim
All sides must engage in constructive dialogue and bring about an end to violence in eastern Ukraine. ,claim
"Russia must take steps to withdraw its equipment and troops from Ukraine, cease its support for the separatists and effectively control its borders. ",claim
the evidence of Russia's support is beyond denial. ,premise
"Two days ago, two companies of Russian troops, including up to 30 armoured personnel carriers and a dozen tanks, were seen crossing the border into Ukraine. ",premise
Daily we see Russian soldiers operating alongside the separatists. ,premise
"We see separatists brandishing the PKP, Russia's  newest machine gun. ",premise
We have also seen Russian- supplied T-72 BM. tanks in the streets of Luhansk and Donetsk. ,premise
Neither the PKP nor the T-72 BM. is used by the Ukrainian armed forces. ,premise
But there is a political way out: through implementation of the agreements that were reached in Minsk in September. ,claim
"However, despite a number of diplomatic initiatives, including today's Normandy-format meeting, more than 1,000 people have been killed since those commitments were made in September, and separatists have taken control of a substantial additional area of Ukrainian territory since the September agreements. ",premise
"Indeed, any analysis of the implementation of the Minsk agreements lays bare the manifest failure of Russia and the separatists to implement 10 out of the 12 commitments made on that occasion. ",premise
Russia's refusal to implement two key provisions continue to undermine the prospects for peace in Ukraine. ,claim
"First, at Minsk, all sides agreed to secure continuous monitoring on the Ukraine/Russian border and verification by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) of the creation of a security zone in the border regions of Ukraine and Russia. ",premise
"Despite the best efforts ofthe OSCE, whose work has been exemplary despite the challenges presented, only two checkpoints are currently monitored on the Russian side, leaving hundreds of kilometres free for the flow of weapons and personnel into Ukraine. ",premise
Russia must stop blocking the expansion of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission. ,claim
"Secondly, at Minsk, all sides agreed ""to remove illegal armed formations, military equipment, fighters and mercenaries from the territory of Ukraine"". ",premise
"Yet hundreds of Russian troops still remain on the territory of Ukraine, as do thousands of so-called volunteers, in flagrant violation of the protocol. ",claim
The withdrawal of those forces is fundamental to the Minsk agreement and the only way to secure the future territorial integrity of Ukraine. ,claim
It is important that the Council continue to pay the closest attention to the situation in Ukraine and insist on further progress towards the implementation of the Minsk agreements. ,claim
Russia has chosen not to uphold its commitments and pursue this path to restoring stability. ,claim
"And Ukraine, sadly, is not the only case. ",premise
"Russia has made an agreement with a breakaway Georgian province of Abkhazia and is in the process of doing the same with another Georgian region, South Ossetia. ",premise
This demonstrates a pattern of Russian interference in the domestic affairs of its neighbours and a blatant disregard for their sovereignty and territorial integrity. ,claim
"We call on Russia to exert its influence over separatists, cease the destabilizing activities and work in good faith to find a political solution. ",claim
The Minsk agreements provide the framework for that solution. ,premise
They must be implemented in full and without delay. ,claim
The current situation in eastern Ukraine remains turbulent ,claim
with an increase in armed clashes and acts of violence resulting in human casualties and the destruction of property. ,premise
"The top priorities now are to effectively and comprehensively implement the Minsk agreements by all parties concerned, to stay calm and exercise restraint, to prevent further escalation of the conflict and confrontation and to achieve as soon as possible a ceasefire and cessation of violence in eastern Ukraine. ",claim
China believes that a political solution is the only way to settle the Ukrainian issue. ,claim
The crisis in Ukraine is rooted in complex historical facts and contemporary causes. ,premise
"A fundamental solution of the Ukrainian issue lies in fully taking into account the legitimate rights and aspirations of all regions and ethnic groups of Ukraine, while addressing the reasonable concerns of all the parties involved so that their interests can be balanced. ",claim
"China welcomes and supports the recent positive efforts of the relevant parties to push for a political solution to the Ukrainian issue and hopes that they will join hands, fully take into account the legitimate interests and reasonable concerns of each side and, through such mediation mechanisms as the Normandy and Minsk formats, and find a comprehensive, balanced and lasting political settlement as soon as possible in order to achieve peace, security, stability and development in Ukraine, as well as in the region as a whole. ",claim
It is China's long-standing position to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries. ,claim
We support all actions conducive to the holding of dialogues and consultations in search of a political solution to the Ukrainian crisis. ,claim
We will maintain our just and objective position by playing a positive and constructive role in finding a political solution to the Ukrainian issue. ,claim
"I would first like to say how deeply concerned we are about the new escalation of the crisis in eastern and southern Ukraine, particularly around the Donetsk airport. ",premise
"We deplore the worsening security situation, which has had serious consequences for the civilian population, who continue to suffer violations and abuses of human rights inflicted by all sides. ",premise
"We urge the parties to comply fully with the ceasefire, as monitored and verified by the Special Monitoring Mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, pursuant to the provisions of the Minsk accords. ",claim
"We are confident in the full ability of all the parties to implement the agreement, which is an inclusive political instrument designed to achieve peace and tranquillity for the entire population of eastern Ukraine. ",claim
We urge all the parties to pursue the high-level dialogue in order to find a peaceful solution to the conflict and to exercise restraint and refrain from unilateral actions that could exacerbate tensions. ,claim
"Until a permanent peaceful solution is found, humanitarian assistance should be provided without delay and in accordance with humanitarian principles. ",claim
The efforts of the international community must be channeled through the host Government ,claim
which has primary responsibility for aiding and protecting its people. ,premise
"We emphasize the continued importance of strengthening the rule of law and the obligation to respect Ukraine's sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, General Assembly resolution 68/262 and international law, as well as respecting the principle of non-intervention and non-interference in the internal affairs of another State. ",claim
"Lastly, we reiterate our support for the Secretary- General's continued efforts to end the situation that Ukraine is enduring, and we hope that the various independent international mechanisms will continue to contribute to resolving this crisis. ",claim
the Russian Federation manipulated two of the basic principles of the United Nations - the right to self-determination and the right to protection - in order to create a fake legal pretext for invading Ukraine. ,claim
"it occupied and then annexed part of the sovereign territory of Ukraine, the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol. ",claim
the Russian Federation will be brought to justice for that particular crime of aggression against Ukraine. ,claim
"the Russian Federation is continuing its military aggression in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine by sending military units into our territory, delivering heavy weapons to the local terrorist groups, training, equipping and financing mercenaries and waging an information war. ",claim
"That aggression is aimed at forcing my Government to change its constitutional and territorial order, thereby undermining the territorial integrity and political sovereignty of Ukraine. ",claim
Every day of the past year has been traumatic for the Ukrainian people. ,claim
"On 8 June, militants from the so-called Donetsk People's Republic tortured and killed eight priests and parishioners of the Protestant church in the Ukrainian city of Slovyansk. ",premise
"On 17 July, Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 was brought down from a zone controlled by the terrorists. ",premise
"Last week, on 13 January, terrorists fired on a passenger bus near the Ukrainian town of Volnovakha, killing 13 and wounding 15 Ukrainian civilians. ",premise
"The ongoing investigation of that tragic terrorist attack on civilians near Volnovakha, and the relevant conclusions of the Special Monitoring Mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ",premise
the shelling was carried out from the north-north-eastern areas currently occupied by illegal armed groups. ,claim
I would like to take this opportunity to express Ukraine's appreciation for the Council's strong condemnation of that terrorist act. ,claim
My country is waging a war against terrorism. ,claim
"It is fighting on the front lines for such universal values as freedom, sovereignty and democracy. ",claim
"In the wake of the Minsk agreements of 5 and 19 September 2014, the President of Ukraine declared a ceasefire and began to implement all points, without exception, ofthe agreement signed by the representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the rebels. ",premise
Despite the fact that they are signatories to the agreements ,premise
the Russian side and Russian-backed terrorists have persistently and brutally violated the Minsk provisions. ,claim
the illegal armed groups have occupied more than 550 square kilometres since September. ,premise
the terrorists' lack of compliance with the ceasefire regime ,claim
during this period Ukraine has lost 237 military troops and at least 148 civilians. ,premise
the shelling of Ukrainian positions has increased. ,claim
in the past 10 days alone the total shelling has surpassed the numbers for the whole of the previous month. ,premise
the Russian side has significantly increased its military presence in Donbas and has filled the region with highly sophisticated heavy weapons. ,claim
The terrorists recently announced that they have created their own air force. ,premise
We presume that is a manoeuvre to cover up the future deployment and use of Russian military aircraft in action. ,claim
"The build-up of Russian troops at the Ukrainian border has also increased and has now reached 50,000. ",claim
What is a battalion of the 76th Airborne Division from Pskov doing in the residential areas of Heorhiivka and Komachova? ,premise
What is a battalion doing in the residential areas of Pobeda and Hryhorivka? ,premise
A battalion is around 400 or 500 men. ,premise
What is a separate air-assault brigade from Ulyanovsk doing in the area of Starobeshevo? ,premise
There is a battalion from the 76th Motorized Brigade from Maikop and the 49th Brigade from Stavropol. ,premise
"What are armed units from Volgograd, Kaliningrad, Kostroma, Shilovo, Yurga, Aleysk, Gusinoozyorsk, Pecheneg, Sputnik, Novorossiysk, Tula, Naro-Fominsk and elsewhere in Ukraine? ",premise
"These amount to more than 8,000 troops. ",premise
"Are they on vacation, as we have heard many times in clarification from the Russian side? ",premise
Do their families know where they are? ,premise
but the Russian families of troops killed tell a different story. ,premise
What is this if not aggression? ,claim
"the illegal armed groups intensified their attacks and shelling after receiving reinforcements from the territory of the Russian Federation, including in the form of Russia's so-called humanitarian convoys. ",claim
"We denounce the provocative statements made by Russian officials, who have tried to shift responsibility for violations onto Ukraine, including those which the Russian delegation has made to the Security Council today. ",claim
"Ukraine remains fully committed to a peaceful settlement of the crisis, which should be based on the Minsk agreements and on full respect for the territorial integrity, sovereignty and political unity of Ukraine. ",claim
We have twice initiated a ceasefire and unilaterally adhered to it. ,premise
"On 13 November 2014, representatives of Ukraine and Russia signed a working document envisaging a clear schedule for the implementation of the provisions of the Minsk agreements, in particular concerning assurances of the bilateral ceasefire, the withdrawal of heavy weapons and return to the touch-line. ",premise
The Russian side recalled its signature under that document. ,premise
"On 18 January, Ukraine once again reiterated its appeal to the Russian Federation and suggested that Russia should sign the timetable for the implementation of the Minsk agreements, as worded on 13 November 2014, and to ensure that the ceasefire would start on 19 January. ",premise
We believe that it will allow us to immediately resume the ceasefire and to protect civilians from the attacks carried out by the militants in the region in the course of the past four months. ,claim
"The beginning of the strict implementation of the document will create appropriate conditions for holding consultations of the trilateral contact group in the near future, and later the summit of Heads of State and Government to be held in Astana. ",claim
We demand that the plan be finally implemented. ,claim
"Ukraine is ready to sign the ceasefire agreement, given our full adherence to the Minsk agreements. ",claim
Ukraine is striving for peace. ,premise
We still expect the same commitment to the Minsk agreements on the part of the Russian side. ,claim
it is the President of the Russian Federation who has repeatedly confirmed his adherence to the implementation of the Minsk agreements in their full scope and without exception. ,premise
"That position was affirmed, inter alia, at the multilateral summit in Milan. ",premise
"the delegation of the United States showed its hand, and we know why. ",premise
It was to create yet another propagandist controversy. ,claim
The representative of the United States went beyond the Ukrainian topic and made a number of inappropriate insinuations regarding Russia's policies. ,premise
the United States has played a destructive and - if we are to speak frankly - a provocative role. ,claim
"After every visit of high-ranking United States officials to Ukraine, the Kyiv Government has stepped up the confrontational nature of its activities, and the current military escalation horrifically coincides with the visit to Kyiv of the commander of the American forces in Europe. ",premise
"It is surprising that wherever Washington, DC, turns its gaze f be it Iraq, Libya, Syria, Ukraine, everywhere - we see destabilization, crises and bloodshed. ",premise
"Perhaps the United States believes that Europe does not have enough problems and that the eastern part of the continent needs a long, drawn-out crisis. ",premise
"the conflict in Transnistria could have been settled back in 2005 ifWashington, D.C., had not intervened at the last moment, convincing Chisinau not to sign the prepared agreement. ",claim
"Abkhazia, in South Ossetia, would not have declared its independence ifin 2001 Washington, DC, had not provoked an eruption of the already unbalanced regime of Saakashvili. ",claim
the Ukrainian delegation has never uttered a respectful word and has actually been insulting when referring to the south- eastern part of his country. ,claim
"He uses the terms ""bandits"" and ""terrorists"". ",premise
"Sometimes the Ukrainian political elite calls them ""inhuman"" or ""insects"". ",premise
it is now time to do so with political courage and to understand that there is no other way to keep Ukraine whole. ,claim
"I certainly understand the desire of the representative of the Russian Federation to speak about other conflicts and other crises, rather than the situation and their tactics of continuing to support the separatists who are wreaking havoc in Ukraine. ",claim
"It seems that while Russia continues the same tactics of supporting the separatists in Ukraine, it also continues its same tactics in the Council - distracting and demonstrating a repeated preference for fantasy over fact. ",claim
Russia and the separatists it supports have taken practically no steps to implement the September Minsk agreements. ,claim
"For example, attacks are continuing past the agreed ceasefire line. ",premise
"Weapons, heavy artillery and military personnel continue to flow across the border from Russia to the separatists. ",premise
"The border remains unsecured and hostages are still being held, including on Russian territory. ",premise
"Ukraine has taken great strides to implement the provisions of the 5 September Minsk protocol, including twice declaring a unilateral ceasefire as separatists continued to fire. ",claim
It has been claimed that Ukraine is building up its military presence and resorting to militarization. ,premise
Ukraine is attempting to hold the ceasefire line agreed to on 19 September. ,premise
The fact that the Russian-backed separatists have decided to ignore the line and try to take additional territory does not provide a basis to renegotiate that line. ,claim
The line should not be renegotiated ,claim
the separatists have gained additional territory through repeated ceasefire violations since September. ,premise
there is no need to renegotiate a new peace plan or a new ceasefire line. ,claim
"The September Minsk agreements, which provide for a cessation of fighting, permanent international monitoring of the border, the removal of all Russian equipment and personnel from the Ukrainian territory, the release of all hostages, and increased autonomy for the region within Ukrainian law, remain the best path to de-escalating the conflict. ",premise
"What the Russians seem to be doing is not to implement Minsk, but to redraft the line of control articulated in it. ",claim
"Russia and the separatists it supports should fulfil the commitments they made in September, rather than attempt to reopen negotiations while increasing the level of violence and attacks to change the facts on the ground. ",premise
"We need more facts, less fantasy. ",claim
"We need more implementation of Minsk, not more distractions from it. ",claim
"Power decided that she had not been eloquent enough in setting out the American position, and that her Deputy needed to repeat some portions of her statement. ",premise
yesterday morning we sent to all members of the Security Council - including the Russian Federation - information on the social and humanitarian situation in Donbas and the measures taken by the Government of Ukraine to meet the needs of the Ukrainian citizens in Donbas. ,premise
I do not know why the Russian colleague has told the mistruth that we are not commenting on Ukraine's policy of inclusiveness. ,claim
"On mobilization, yes, we are in the process of reforming our army, which was fully destroyed in recent years. ",claim
"Because of the facts expressed today - the enlargement ofthe Russian military presence in in Donbas, Ukraine, with thousands of Russian nationals and sophisticated weaponry. ",premise
We have a right to defend ourselves. ,premise
"That is why we are doing so, ourselves. ",claim
"Based on the United Nations principle of collective self-defence, we have called on many countries and organizations for assistance. ",premise
It has not been easy to get a response ,premise
we have not received any weaponry equal to the Russians'. ,premise
That is why we are doing what we are doing to defend ourselves. ,claim
It is our right. ,premise
Ukrainian citizens in Donbas who are under the terrorist threat. ,claim
"Those who killed the passengers of Flight MH-l7, those who killed priests and those who killed civilians are terrorists and they would be considered terrorists anywhere, whatever their nationality or the threat they represent. ",premise
We are participating in the common fight against terrorism. ,claim
They are terrorists and they are called by that name ,claim
their actions identify them as terrorists. ,premise
Lithuania condemns in the strongest terms the attacks on Mariupol ,claim
The bloodiest conflict in Europe since the Balkan wars is taking place as we speak. ,claim
"the Security Council members once again expressed concern at the situation and urged all parties to the conflict, including Russia, to return to the Minsk agreements and ensure their prompt and full implementation in order to prevent even more destruction and bloodshed. ",premise
"what we saw over the weekend was more deadly shelling, more destruction, and more human tragedy caused by the Kremlin's unbridled mercenaries, including the deadly attack on Mariupol, which this Council failed to condemn because Russia put protecting the militants above condemning the perpetrators. ",claim
"After 29 open briefings and no progress on the ground, it is hard not to sound repetitive here. ",claim
"However, we cannot let Ukraine fall through the cracks of international attention ",claim
"More than 5,000 dead, some 11,000 injured and about 1.5 million displaced - such is the cost of Russia's continued aggression against Ukraine. ",premise
"Almost 50,000 people have fled their homes since 14 January; at least 262 people were killed between 13 and 21 January alone. ",premise
"Last week again, from 75 to 115 shelling attacks on Ukrainian positions took place every day. ",premise
"The Donetsk airport, which the Kremlin-sponsored militants captured last week, has been pounded to rubble by months of attacks, causing destruction seen only in the worst of wars. ",premise
Some 550 square kilometres of land have been captured by the illegal militants since the beginning of the ceasefire. ,premise
Such are the realities of what we continue to call a ceasefire. ,claim
"Just like the breaches of the 1991 Alma Ata Declaration, the 1994 Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances, the 1997 Black Sea Fleet Agreement Between the Russian Federation and Ukraine and various other documents, including the more recent the Geneva statement and the Berlin joint declaration, the Minsk agreements are just another casualty of Russia's aggression against neighbouring Ukraine. ",premise
"One does not seek peace by arming illegal fighters in a neighbouring country with advanced artillery systems, multiple rocket launchers, truckloads of arms and ammunition, and tanks. ",claim
One does not seek peace by sending one's own troops and commandos to fight on the soil of one's neighbour. ,claim
"One does not seek peace by issuing continuous threats and intimidations vis-a-vis one's neighbour, or by annexing parts ofthe neighbour's territory. ",claim
One does not seek peace by unleashing a continuous barrage of hate-mongering propaganda and lies aimed at dehumanizing and demonizing one's neighbour. ,claim
"As long as Russia persists on this course, let us be frank, peace in Ukraine has no chance. ",claim
"Last Saturday, Ukraine suffered the second deadliest single incident on its soil since the downing of flight MH-l7 in July 2014. ",premise
Some 30 people were killed and about 90 wounded during the shelling of the city of Mariupol. ,premise
repeatedly stated his disdain for the ceasefire. ,claim
"""There is no ceasefire. ",premise
We will fight. ,premise
I promise ,premise
"""There will be no more ceasefires or rotations There will be no attempts to talk about ceasefire from our side. ",premise
"Kyiv does not understand that we are now able to attack on three fronts at once."" ",premise
"""Today the offensive against Mariupol begins. ",premise
"In a few days we will swallow the Debaltsevo kettle"". ",premise
"Russia continues to blame Ukraine for ceasefire violations, including the Mariupol attack. ",claim
Anti-Ukrainian rhetoric is not abating. ,claim
"aggressive anti-Ukrainian propaganda has been used to brainwash, confuse, distract and obfuscate. ",claim
The international community should not and must not give in to these obfuscations. ,claim
"Therefore, let me ask again: How can a bunch of illegal militants expand their offensive, continue capturing territory and threaten to carry out attacks on three fronts against the State of Ukraine? ",premise
"How can a bunch of illegal militants without external trade ties, income or budget amass hundreds of armored combat vehicles, artillery systems and rocket launchers - all those Tochka-U tactical missile launch systems, Grad rockets, Uragan and Buratino rocket launchers? ",premise
"How can they afford modern tanks, each of which costs at least $4 million? ",premise
How can they claim their own air fleet? ,premise
How can hundreds of Russian soldiers be dying on Ukraine's soil if they are not even there? ,premise
How come hundreds of Russian mothers receive the dead bodies of their sons in Cargo 200 boxes from a conflict to which Russia claims it is not a party? ,premise
"How come, in spite of the devastating lawlessness and countless crimes committed by the separatist militants and registered in the reports of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, Russia has not even once, not even mildly, condemned the perpetrators? ",premise
"All of this, as well as Russia's persistent protectiveness of the illegal militants, speak to Russia's direct involvement in and support for the war in Ukraine. ",claim
That involvement has been confirmed by certain militant leaders. ,premise
"the same Alexander Zakharchenko said that thousands of Russian citizens, including many professional soldiers, were fighting alongside the separatists. ",premise
"the Russian commando Igor Girkin - who is also known as Strelkov and who played a big role in stoking war in eastern Ukraine - recently boasted to the press about having started the war by crossing the border with his squad, saying that if it had not been for them, there would have been no separatism in eastern Ukraine. ",premise
he also said the Crimea referendum was carried out at gunpoint - something many of us have been repeating since the bogus plebiscite was held. ,premise
"Life in eastern Ukraine may have been far from perfect due, to long years of neglect by successive Governments, yet the local inhabitants, many of them Russian speakers, had homes to return to after work, had their daily lives and had their daily bread. ",claim
"Thanks to the Kremlin's decision to ""protect"" Russian speakers ",premise
"they now have no homes, no jobs and no income and may have lost dear ones or may be dead themselves. ",claim
"Russia's war, Russia's proxies and the abysmal lawlessness they imposed have brought destruction, displacement and death to the region. ",claim
"In spite of all the ceasefire violations and military attacks, the Ukrainian leadership firmly maintains that the Minsk agreements are the only way forward towards peace. ",claim
the Minsk agreements must be implemented by all the parties to the conflict - Russia included f in full and without arbitrary revisions or manipulation. ,claim
"The onus is on Russia to put an end to this senseless war by ending support to illegal armed groups, accepting international monitoring of the Ukrainian-Russian border, withdrawing its troops and weaponry from eastern Ukraine, ensuring the release by the illegal militants of all illegally detained persons, including Nadiya Savchenko - who is being held illegally on Russian territory - ending the manipulation of humanitarian assistance and reaffirming its respect for Ukraine's sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity. ",claim
"International observers, including the United Nations and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe monitoring missions, must be provided full and unconditional access to the entire territory of Ukraine, including Crimea. ",claim
Their reporting is indispensable to get the facts straight. ,premise
The Russian Federation is seriously concerned about the escalation of the situation in Ukraine. ,claim
"Cities in south-east Ukraine have been subjected to indiscriminate shelling by heavy weaponry for countless days, resulting in hundreds of civilian casualties. ",premise
We resolutely condemn such actions against the civilian population. ,claim
the armed forces of Ukraine have fired virtually non-stop on the largest city in Dombas - Donetsk. ,claim
"Just over the past week, at least 27 civilians have died and 71 people have been injured, and 105 residences and 3 hospitals, as well as 2 kindergartens and 3 schools, have also been destroyed. ",premise
"Overall, 2,367 residential buildings have been destroyed. ",premise
There has also been intensive shelling against Horlivka ,claim
"The last week was the most difficult for Horlivka since last summer: 107 people died, including 9 children. ",premise
Three hundred and seventeen people have been injured. ,premise
"Hospitals, 15 schools and dozens of preschools have been damaged. ",premise
"On 21 January approximately 10 civilians died as a result of the shelling of the city of Stakhanov, Luhansk oblast, using Uragan multiple rocket launcher systems. ",premise
On 21 January approximately 10 civilians died. ,premise
That is far from a comprehensive list of all the cities under the control of self-defence formations in which civilians are dying every day. ,premise
Yet the news cycles over the past few days have focused on two incidents alone: the shelling of a bus in Volnovakha and that of a residential neighbourhood in Mariupol. ,premise
both cities are controlled by Kyiv's forces. ,claim
A similar tragedy in Donetsk in which a bus stop was shelled did not lead to mourning in Kyiv or to the convening of emergency meetings of the Security Council. ,premise
It was not even worthy of a statement by the Secretary-General. ,premise
Is it that in the areas and cities controlled by the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics we have second class citizens? ,claim
It is impossible not to look at the fact that Kyiv has used the tragedies of recent days to fan the flames of hysteria. ,claim
Accusations against self-defence formations are voiced immediately after events occur - almost as if they have been prepared in advance. ,premise
Calls immediately emanate from Kyiv to Western capitals for financial and military assistance and for exerting pressure on the Russian Federation. ,premise
"However, as soon as the propaganda value ends, interest falls away very quickly in using the situation further and continuing investigation - all the more so given that, once some time has passed, one finds that the facts sometimes fall quite short of what was said initially. ",premise
"we call for objective investigation of the January tragedies in Volnovakha, Donetsk and Mariupol, as well as earlier tragedies, including in the Maidan, Odesa and Mariupol. ",claim
the members of the Security Council were not able to agree on a statement to the press with regard to the tragedy in Mariupol. ,premise
"The need to issue a statement was as evident to us as it was in the cases of Volnovakha and Donetsk, and we were ready to back a similar text. ",premise
Why has it not been possible this time? ,premise
"the delegations of the United States, the United Kingdom and Lithuania insisted on including in the text condemnation of one statement by the leader of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, taken out of context of recent events and the entire crisis in Ukraine. ",claim
"First, the leaders of the self-defence formations made different statements the day before yesterday. ",premise
One cannot cite them selectively or take them out of context. ,premise
"Secondly, we have never heard anything from our Western colleagues in condemnation of the leaders of Ukraine, who have no shame when it comes to their statements and actions. ",premise
"There are threats that Dombas is going to be punched in the mouth, that it will be taken back by force and that it will be Ukrainized - and that the population has to prepare for ""a major continental war"", to which there is allegedly no alternative ",claim
"Russian Security Council draft documents on very important issues - putting an end to the blood-letting, the humanitarian situation in Dombas - were repeatedly unsuccessful. ",claim
"Take, for instance, a press statement in support of the Minsk agreements blocked by Lithuania and the United States of America, which was immediately submitted after they were made public, on 22 September. ",premise
"Following the shelling of a public transport stop in Donetsk, which was clearly carried out by Ukrainian forces, for a day we had to swat away unconstructive amendments by a number of delegations. ",premise
It was by exerting pressure that we were able to agree to a text at the end of the day. ,claim
"throughout this entire conflict our Western colleagues have spent all their time accusing the self-defence formations of inhuman crimes, while they fully justify the actions of the Kyiv authorities. ",claim
We have seen no constructive attempts to discuss the real reasons for the Ukrainian internal conflict and try to find a way out of the current situation. ,claim
The escalation of the situation in Dombas ,claim
the result of the Kyiv authorities consistently rejecting direct dialogue with Donetsk and Luhansk on the issue of the practical implementation of the Minsk agreements. ,premise
we noticed the steps taken by the Kyiv forces to strengthen their military positions in the south-east. ,claim
"They deployed forces, equipment and heavy weaponry along the line of contact, as well as calling for new mobilizations and putting in new factory orders for defence equipment. ",premise
Measures for the economic reconstruction of Dombas were replaced by attempts to suppress the regions beyond their control. ,premise
"First they stopped paying pensions and social benefits, and then imposed a blockade on humanitarian assistance. ",premise
Kyiv was preparing for war - something they did not hide in any way. ,claim
"But everything could have been quite different if the Minsk ceasefire memorandum had been implemented in a timely manner, including the handing over of heavy weaponry and handing over the Donetsk airport to the self-defence formations. ",claim
We would have avoided a new cycle of confrontation had the Ukrainian authorities accepted the 15 January proposal of Russian President Vladimir Putin on the immediate withdrawal of heavy weaponry. ,claim
"It is quite clear that peace in Dombas is something that is undesirable to the ""war party"" in Kyiv. ",premise
"The Kyiv authorities have been sabotaging the holding of a regular meeting of the contact group in Minsk, unjustifiably conditioning it on high-level representation by the self-defence formations. ",claim
The main thing now is to hold this meeting and not to quibble over the level of the participants. ,claim
"We will continue to prompt the parties towards direct dialogue, as we have done during the whole course of the internal Ukrainian crisis. ",claim
"we urge the representatives of States that possess some form of influence with Ukraine's leadership, especially Washington, DC, to stop egging on the Ukrainian hawks, covering and justifying their inhumane actions, and pushing them towards a military solution to the conflict. ",claim
That will only lead to an even greater catastrophe and create another hotbed of tension in Europe. ,premise
All responsible members of the international community must strive to attain from Kyiv not words but actions in the interest of launching a full-fledged political settlement process. ,claim
"Until the Kyiv party of war understands that force alone cannot resolve the conflict, and that multiple-launch rocket systems, tactical ballistic missiles, phosphorous and cluster munitions, and renewed mobilizations will not help it ",premise
such incidents will occur over and over again. ,claim
The Kyiv authorities must be forced to sit down at negotiation table with the self-defence formations. ,claim
"It is important that everyone understand that real results can be achieved only through direct dialogue between Kyiv and Donetsk and Luhansk, which the Ukrainian authorities have shirked thus far, having chosen a course of suppressing south-eastern Ukraine by military means. ",claim
"Without inclusive, direct political dialogue, which should allow us to properly negotiate the parameters for constitutional reform as required by the Geneva communique and the Minsk agreements, ",premise
the national reconciliation of Ukraine and a sustainable settlement in the south-east will not occur. ,claim
we saw the biggest single loss of civilian life in the Ukrainian crisis since the commitments made at Minsk on 5 September last year. ,claim
"Thirty civilians were killed and over 100 wounded following what the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) termed ""an extremely heavy barrage"" of rockets fired indiscriminately into the crowded streets of Mariupol. ",premise
"That attack, many kilometres over the agreed ceasefire line, has taken the scope and threat of the conflict to a substantially new level. ",claim
The attack was just not another refusal of the separatist leadership to abide by the commitments made at Minsk ,claim
"it was a provocative and reckless escalation that, as the Secretary-General has made clear, could constitute a violation of international humanitarian law. ",claim
Those responsible for the attack must be held accountable for their actions. ,claim
"No one in the Council can deny the fact that the attack on Mariupol, like last week's on a bus near Volnovakha, came from the Russian-backed separatists. ",claim
The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission analysis of both attacks indicates clearly that in both incidents the rockets were fired from separatist-held territory. ,premise
The attack would not have been possible without the military support of Russia and its supply of multiple-launch Grad and Uragan rocket systems to the separatists. ,premise
"Russia has transferred to the separatists hundreds of additional heavy weapons, not just rocket systems but also heavy artillery, tanks and armoured vehicles. ",premise
"Hundreds of Russian regular forces and special forces continue to operate on Ukrainian territory, in clear violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. ",claim
"These soldiers are backed by Russian command-and-control elements, air defence systems, drones and electronic warfare systems ",claim
"There is no doubt that the flow of heavy weapons across those borders, in violation of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine, has given the separatists the fire power and the confidence to escalate the conflict. ",claim
the separatists have taken control of an additional 550 square kilometres of territory. ,premise
"hundreds of kilometres of border remain free for the flow of these deadly weapons, often under the guise of humanitarian convoys. ",premise
Russia's persistent blocking of the proposed expansion of the OSCE border monitoring reveals its true intentions. ,claim
"Russia arms the separatists, it finances them, it advises them, and it fights covertly alongside them. ",claim
"That statement, and others like it, cannot be glibly ignored, as the Russian representative encourages us to do. ",claim
It is the reality. ,premise
"While Russia professes adherence to the Minsk agreement and the Normandy format meetings, and while it accuses the Ukrainian Government of provocations, the separatist forces that it supports are bent on undermining those agreements, attacking civilians and creating new realities on the ground. ",claim
as we have seen in Mariupol this weekend ,premise
will only lead us closer to the precipice. ,claim
"It will lead to more deaths, more destruction and more people displaced from their homes. ",premise
We assert quite rightly that these are fundamental principles of the Charter of the United Nations. ,claim
They provide the foundation for an international system that is based on rules and respect and the preservation of international peace and security. ,premise
"We all defend these principles because we do not want a world where borders are redrawn by force, where States are threatened and destabilized by their neighbours, and where innocent civilian populations live in fear of battle orders issued in far-off capitals. ",premise
The Security Council has to make very clear where it stands against the profoundly dangerous path that Russia is pursuing in east Ukraine. ,claim
I urge all Council members to be clear in their messaging today. ,claim
Russia must withdraw its equipment and troops. ,claim
"It must cease its support for the separatists, and it must effectively control its borders. ",claim
It must use its influence over the separatists to stabilize the situation and prevent further dangerous escalation. ,claim
It must play its full part in ensuring the immediate implementation of the Minsk protocol. ,claim
"the representative of the Russian Federation has claimed that his country wants a peaceful resolution to the conflict, but such words are worthless in themselves. ",premise
We need to see Russian actions to put a stop to this widening and increasingly deadly conflict. ,claim
"Members of the Council pressed Russia and the separatists not only to recommit themselves to the agreements they had made at Minsk, but actually to honour those commitments in their actions. ",premise
Russia and the separatists have once again flouted those commitments. ,claim
Russia's end goal remains the same - to seize more territory and move the line of Russian-controlled territory deeper and deeper into Ukraine. ,claim
statements by the separatists are complicating Russia's strategy. ,claim
"On Friday 23 January, the de facto leader of the Russian-backed separatists in Donetsk, Alexander Zakharchenko, said ""today the offensive on Mariupol begins"". ",premise
"He also said ""there will be no more ceasefires"". ",premise
"He said the separatists would not stop their attacks until they had ""reached the borders of the former Donetsk region"", bragging that separatist forces were now ""able to attack in three directions simultaneously"". ",premise
The representative of the Russian Federation today said that these are statements we have taken out of context. ,premise
What context possibly justifies a massive offensive against a civilian-populated town? ,claim
"attacking in three directions, as the separatist leader said his forces had the capability to do, takes a lot of weapons and forces. ",claim
This capability reflects the difference made by the substantial months- long influx of Russian personnel and heavy weapons. ,premise
If only the separatists' words had been empty  bravado. ,claim
"on Saturday the world witnessed the horrors that resulted from the separatist attack on Mariupol, a city 25 kilometres outside ofthe Minsk line. ",premise
"On Saturday alone, more than 100 people were injured in rocket attacks on the city. ",premise
"Approximately 30 people were killed, including women, elderly and children, one of whom was a four-year old boy. ",premise
"Some 40 rounds of rockets struck the city, hitting a market, homes and a school, among other civilian structures. ",premise
The impartial Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine examined blast craters and concluded that they had been caused by Grad rockets fired from multi-rocket launcher systems in separatist-controlled areas. ,premise
Why do these locations matter to the Russians and the separatists? ,claim
Mariupol is a port city that would provide Russia with another means of supplying separatists. ,premise
And controlling the city would be another step toward creating a land-bridge to illegally occupied Crimea. ,premise
Debaltsevo is a strategic rail and road hub and serves as a key link between the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. ,premise
It is no accident that these strategic cities are in Russia's sights. ,claim
"Now sometimes, perhaps given the fog of this bloody war, the separatists are too explicit about their objectives. ",claim
"Indeed, after initially blasting around the separatists' Mariupol ambitions in the news service, Russia began to see the same ghastly images and reports of the carnage that the rest of us saw. ",premise
"At that point, perhaps knowing the source of the weaponry used, Russia tried to deny any tie between the separatists and the attacks. ",claim
The Russian news service Tass even tried to erase from official news stories all quotes from Zakharchenko speaking about the separatists' attacks. ,premise
Russia does not want the world to hear separatist statements. ,claim
"Last Wednesday, the representative of the Russian Federation told the Council that ""the Russian Federation is ensuring full compliance with the Minsk accords"" (S/PV7365, p. 7). ",premise
"On Saturday, however, Zakharchenko openly admitted that his forces were violating those same accords. ",premise
"He appeared not to have gotten the Russian memo, which clearly calls for violating the accords while pretending you are not. ",premise
"Despite Zakharchenko's statements, Russia continues to try to play the international community for the fool and blame the violence on the Ukrainians. ",claim
"As recently as yesterday, Foreign Minister Lavrov said ""the worsening situation in Ukraine was the result of constant attacks conducted by the Ukrainian Government troops, which breached the Minsk agreements"". ",premise
Zakharchenko's statements are a problem for Russia because they are too straightforward. ,claim
"As members of the Council know - and as, increasingly, all the world can see - the separatists he claims to lead are trained and equipped by Russia and fight with Russian forces by their side. ",premise
"So when Zakharchenko brags about seizing territory beyond the Minsk ceasefire line; when he announces at rallies that separatists will strike Ukrainian forces without provocation; and when he says that he is not interested in negotiating, he is not only speaking about the separatists' intentions but also about Russia's intentions. ",claim
This offensive is made in Moscow. ,claim
"It is waged by Russian-trained and Russian- funded separatists who use Russian missiles and Russian tanks, who are backed up by Russian troops, and whose operations receive direct Russian assistance. ",premise
"Since December, Russia has transferred hundreds of pieces of military equipment to pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine, including tanks, armored vehicles, rocket systems, heavy artillery and other military equipment. ",premise
"And in recent weeks, Russia has resupplied the separatists with hundreds of pieces of advanced weaponry, including additional rocket systems, heavy artillery, tanks and armoured vehicles. ",premise
"In mid to late January, notwithstanding the shootdown of flight MH-17, Russia even deployed into eastern Ukraine advanced surface-to-air missile and anti-aircraft systems, marking the highest level of Russian air-defence presence in Eastern Ukraine since September 2014. ",premise
"There is a direct correlation between the movement of heavy weapons and the surge in that movement across the border, and attempts by separatists to take more ground. ",premise
The horror wrought by this arsenal has been deadly. ,claim
"According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, the period from 13 to 21 January was the deadliest on record since the 5 September agreement was signed in Minsk. ",premise
"During this time, an average of 29 people were killed each day. ",premise
"More than 5,000 people have been killed and almost 11,000 maimed since the conflict began in April 2014. ",premise
"the attacks continue on the civilian-populated areas over the Minsk ceasefire lines, not only in Mariupol and Debaltsevo, but also in Pisky and Stanichno-Luhansk. ",premise
"To the Russians, Mariupol and Debaltsevo may just be strategic chess pieces in their effort to move the line of territory that they control, but these cities are also home to hundreds ofthousands okarainian civilians. ",claim
"Nearly 500,000 people live in Mariupol, the second biggest city in the Donetsk region, and more than 25,000 live in Debaltsevo. ",premise
"Mariupol is home to 92 preschools attended by 13,000 children. ",premise
"We continue to believe that the only solution to this situation is a political solution, not a military solution. ",claim
"we continue to support the efforts of the trilateral contact group, as well as the Normandy group of foreign ministers. ",claim
"We welcome the Normandy group's agreement in Berlin, which recognizes the need for the full, immediate implementation of the Minsk agreement. ",claim
"If Russia is serious about peace, why does it not condemn the statements by separatists that they will attack Ukrainians first and accept no more ceasefires, instead of trying to erase those statements from its State-run news services? ",premise
"If Russia is serious about peace, why does it not pull its tanks and Grad missiles out of eastern Ukraine instead of sending in more? ",premise
"If Russia is serious about peace, why does it not withdraw its forces at least to the lines agreed upon at Minsk, rather than send in a huge infusion of Russian heavy weapons so as to carve out new lines? ",premise
Only if Russia takes these steps will there be a chance for the political solution that is so desperately needed. ,claim
We would have all wished to see 2015 begin under better auspices for Ukraine and its stability. ,claim
"The year has barely started, and twice in less than a week the situation on the ground has forced us to meet here. ",premise
"The deaths of 13 civilians in Volnovakha on 13 January, as well as the shelling of a trolleybus in Donetsk last week, which claimed at least eight civilian victims, were already a source of concern, even as the previous day the Russian, Ukrainian, French and German Foreign Ministers had been able to reach an agreement on the withdrawal of heavy weaponry. ",premise
"On Saturday and Sunday in Mariupol, separatist groups attacked residential neighbourhoods with rockets, killing nearly 30 civilians and instilling terror among the population. ",premise
"All reports from the ground, in particular those of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe observers, confirm this. ",premise
"More than a further violation of the ceasefire, this is also a serious violation of the international humanitarian law that protects civilians. ",claim
These acts are unacceptable ,claim
as they indiscriminately target civilians. ,premise
"The offensive against Mariupol, which was provocatively welcomed by Alexander Zakharchenko last Saturday, violated the commitments undertaken by the parties last September in Minsk ",premise
is entirely unacceptable ,claim
Let us not mince words. ,premise
"By supporting the Ukrainian separatists and their actions, ",premise
Russia bears a significant share of responsibility for the violence. ,claim
We must now turn to dialogue and seriously discuss the future of Ukraine and how to restore peace. ,claim
"We also call on Russia to stop supporting the separatists, who are hell- bent on destabilizing the situation ",claim
We call for a long- overdue end to the transfer of weapons and manpower across the Russian-Ukrainian border ,claim
which is fuelling the war and violates the territorial integrity of Ukraine and the most fundamental principles of the Charter of the United Nations ,premise
"which undermines diplomatic efforts seeking to settle the conflict in accordance with international law and the fundamental rights and freedoms of all Ukrainians, including its minorities. ",premise
We urge Russia to use all its influence on the separatists in the east of the country so that they fully respect the ceasefire. ,claim
"announcing the facilitation of contacts between the warring parties, are a positive sign but they are not enough. ",claim
We also call on Ukraine to begin the institutional reform as per its commitments. ,claim
President Poroshenko has spoken publicly of the prospects for national dialogue and institutional reform. ,premise
That statement was a further step towards the comprehensive implementation of the Minsk accords ,premise
which are the only way to achieve a negotiated solution to this crisis. ,claim
"We must also call on all parties to refrain from attacking the civilian population, to respect international humanitarian law and to ensure humanitarian access to the wounded and to civilians in need of assistance. ",claim
We must underscore that there can be no military solution to this conflict. ,claim
Only by all parties fully implementing the Minsk accords and resuming serious diplomatic discussions ,premise
can there be a positive outcome to this crisis. ,claim
Every efforts must be made to that end. ,claim
"In this difficult context, we cannot afford to let down our guard. ",claim
France remains and will remain fully mobilized to achieving a peaceful settlement. ,claim
"Our goals are clear and consistent: respect for the ceasefire, the withdrawal of heavy weaponry on each side of the contact line, a resumption of prisoner exchanges, the resolution of humanitarian issues and the implementation by the parties of all measures under the Minsk accords. ",claim
"France will pursue its efforts, in close contact with our German partners and the Russian and Ukrainian authorities, under the so-called Normandy format. ",claim
We have no time to waste. ,claim
This is not the time for prevarication or hypocrisy. ,claim
Today we must urgently end this conflict ,claim
"which has already claimed more than 5,000 lives and exacted too high a price from Ukraine, from Russia, from the European Union and from the international system as a whole. ",premise
Ukraine has a democratic Constitution and is implementing a process of reform. ,premise
Ukraine made a decisive contribution to nuclear non-proliferation when it decided in 1994 to renounce nuclear weapons. ,premise
Ukraine is a crucial player in the international order. ,claim
We unreservedly support its territorial integrity. ,claim
there should be no violence in Ukraine. ,claim
today we are meeting once again due to an extremely serious deterioration in the situation. ,premise
Spain would have liked the Council to adopt a statement. ,claim
"Unfortunately, this was not the case. ",premise
I therefore vigorously and unreservedly condemn the bombing of urban areas in the city of Mariupol ,claim
which claimed tens of civilian victims and injured more than 100. ,premise
According to the information provided yesterday by the Mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) ,premise
the rockets were launched from locations under the control of rebel groups of the self- proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic. ,premise
The command responsibility for these attacks must be investigated and the perpetrators held responsible and brought to justice. ,claim
we deplore the statement made by Alexander Zakharchenko shortly before the attack on Mariupol. ,premise
The statements constitute a clear violation of the ceasefire and of the Minsk accords. ,claim
The attacks against civilians are a flagrant violation ofinternational law. ,claim
International law puts obligations not only on the parties but also on those within whose capacity it is to act to prevent any further Violation of international law. ,premise
the High Commissioner for Human Rights warned on Friday of the continued presence of foreign fighters in eastern Ukraine ,premise
"in keeping with that of the High Commissioner, they are troops of the Russian Federation. ",premise
"The same source confirmed the presence of sophisticated heavy weaponry in populated areas, under the control of armed rebel groups, and reported repeated violations of the human rights of the civilians trapped there and a lack of the rule of law in those areas. ",premise
The Security Council cannot remain silent. ,claim
It must make itself heard clearly given this situation. ,claim
"We call once again for the full implementation of the Minsk memorandum and protocol, and for the immediate restoration of the ceasefire. ",claim
"We appeal to all those in a position to influence those responsible for their horrendous acts, in particular to Russia, to, in accordance with its status as a signatory to the Minsk accords and to the joint Berlin declaration of 21 January, as well as a member of the OSCE trilateral contact group, and in exercise of its responsibility of the Security Council, contribute to de-escalate the tensions and compel the rebel groups to renounce violence and accept the peaceful and lawful path to pursue their claims. ",claim
The violence and horrific acts of this weekend sought to derail dialogue and undermine the negotiated settlement of the crisis provided for in the Minsk accords. ,premise
We must not allow this to happen. ,claim
we have witnessed a drastic deterioration in the situation in eastern Ukraine ,premise
"with frequent clashes and attacks that have caused heavy casualties among civilians, including women and children. ",premise
China condemns all violent attacks aimed at civilians and expresses its condolences to the victims and its sympathy to their families. ,claim
We support the conduct of an objective investigation of the relevant attacks to determine the truth and bring the perpetrators to justice. ,claim
"Last week, the Security Council held a public meeting on the question of Ukraine (see S/PV.7365). ",premise
The relevant Member States called on the parties to the conflict to take effective measures to as to avoid any escalation of the conflict or confrontation. ,premise
"However, much to our distress, the situation in eastern Ukraine has not improved but, on the contrary, escalated, resulting in a considerable loss of civilian life and property. ",claim
The deterioration of the situation in eastern Ukraine is not in the interest of any party. ,claim
"What is most urgent now is for all parties to be calm and exercise restraint so as to avoid any further escalation of the conflict or confrontation, to bring about a ceasefire and stop the violence in eastern Ukraine and to implement comprehensively the Minsk agreement reached in September. ",claim
All of the parties concerned must make effective efforts to achieve the aforementioned objectives. ,claim
it is necessary to abide by the overall objective of seeking a political settlement ,claim
"to fully consider the complex historical factors and the reality of the issue relating to Ukraine; to take into full account the legitimate rights, interests and demands of all regions and ethnic communities in Ukraine ",claim
"and to attach great importance to addressing the legitimate concerns of all parties and ensure that the interests of all sides are accommodated in a balanced manner, so as to arrive at a fundamental and enduring solution to the question of Ukraine. ",claim
The international community must make greater diplomatic efforts to promote the quest for a political settlement of the issue. ,claim
Discussions held by the Security Council must play a constructive role in helping to ease the situation in Ukraine. ,claim
China has consistently held that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries should be respected. ,premise
Chinas has adopted an objective and fair position concerning the question of Ukraine. ,premise
We support the relevant parties of the international community in their efforts to seek a political settlement of the question of Ukraine. ,claim
China calls on all parties to make greater efforts and to bring into full play the role of the Normandy and Minsk mediation mechanisms. ,claim
"the conflict in the country has intensified, and civilians continue to suffer the consequences ",claim
"The rocket attacks on Mariupol, which left 30 people dead and more than 100 injured, including women and children, serve to illustrate this point. ",premise
Nigeria condemns in the strongest terms indiscriminate attacks on residential areas. ,claim
"They serve no military purpose, they violate international law and they are unacceptable. ",premise
We call on both sides to immediately de-escalate the fighting and respect the terms of the ceasefire agreement reached at the Minsk peace talks. ,claim
We stress that there can be no military solution to the conflict in Ukraine. ,claim
The parties should seek a political solution through dialogue. ,claim
It is important that the concerns of the separatists be addressed within the framework of a negotiated political settlement. ,claim
"That should be done without compromising the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine. ",claim
which has caused loss of civilian lives and untold numbers of injuries ,premise
"Venezuela reiterates its call on the parties to promote a peaceful, negotiated, political solution to the crisis. ",claim
"We stress that any violent incident on the ground should be investigated independently, and that the investigation's conclusions should be based on irrefutable evidence. ",claim
"Venezuela rejects any act of violence or terrorism, in particular attacks against civilians, from wherever they originate. ",claim
The intensification of the armed conflict in eastern Ukraine ,premise
the parties put an end to their hostilities in the area. ,claim
The ceasefire is therefore a crucial step. ,claim
"It is necessary to continue on the path of seeking a political and diplomatic solution to the Ukrainian crisis, in which the conflicting parties commit to working on achieving a firm and lasting peace. ",claim
"The mediation efforts by regional organizations is, in our View, particularly important in the process of finding a negotiated settlement to the conflict. ",claim
we encourage the parties to work together for its implementation. ,claim
The Minsk agreements are the basis on which lasting peace can be achieved in the region. ,premise
any intervention by outside elements that violate the Minsk agreements and regional efforts to reach an agreement between the parties should be avoided. ,claim
Venezuela stresses that the parties must act with a sense of restraint in order to prevent the dialogue from being undermined by unilateral actions that jeopardize the peace process. ,claim
The cycle of violence must be broken. ,claim
"Building the foundation for peace involves putting an end to hate speech, ethnic persecution and war propaganda. ",premise
The historic and root causes of the conflict must be addressed and a political agreement between the parties must be sought. ,claim
"The escalation in hostilities requires strict compliance by the belligerent parties with obligations concerning the protection of civilians in the areas affected by violence, including the need to ensure humanitarian access to internally displaced persons, refugees and others residents in areas affected by the conflict. ",premise
"Finally, we again call on all parties to redouble their efforts in the search for a just and lasting political solution, which is in their own interests and those of the entire region. ",claim
New Zealand condemns the killing of approximately 30 people and the injuring of more than 90 civilians on 24 January in Mariupol. ,claim
"The reports of indiscriminate shelling of civilian populations and residential areas are deeply concerning, as indeed are the other incidents that were outlined by Under-Secretary-General Feltman. ",premise
The Mariupol incident confirms that the situation in eastern Ukraine is now on a disastrous downward spiral. ,premise
"Its occurrence, magnitude and the claims made about it by the separatist leadership speak for themselves. ",premise
It was a major assault on a civilian population with the sole purpose of taking and controlling the area as a result. ,claim
The most recent civilian casualties from the conflict in eastern Ukraine are completely unacceptable. ,claim
We call on all sides to respect international humanitarian law and to refrain from any indiscriminate attacks. ,claim
we note that rockets have been launched indiscriminately into civilian areas - a violation of international humanitarian law. ,premise
There can be no impunity for such reckless acts. ,claim
Those responsible must be held accountable for their actions. ,claim
Russia's provision of troops and materiel to '6  the separatists is irresponsible. ,premise
"The threat of a major Ukrainian war"" is both chilling and wholly inappropriate, and it may now be close to a reality. ",claim
Russia is unapologetic for the role it is playing in supporting the separatists. ,claim
Russia speaks about the facts. ,premise
What we know for a fact is that Russia is playing a role in this conflict. ,premise
We support the promotion of a fully inclusive political dialogue. ,claim
"We call on Russia, instead of blaming others, to use the diplomatic and other tools it has available to ensure that the separatists respect a ceasefire. ",claim
"That ceasefire, as already agreed on in the Minsk accords, must be implemented immediately. ",claim
The Council must also live up to its responsibilities under the Charter of the United Nations. ,claim
"We must put politics aside, difficult although that may be, and use our collective influence to stop the killing of civilians in eastern Ukraine. ",claim
That must be the priority. ,claim
We join in the condemnation of the indiscriminate shelling of residential areas in the city of Mariupol ,claim
an attack that constitutes a significant and worrying escalation of the level of violence in eastern Ukraine. ,premise
Those responsible for such deplorable acts against the civilian population must be held accountable ,claim
we emphasize the absolute necessity for an objective investigation of the facts that will see that those responsible are brought to justice. ,claim
The violence must end ,claim
"Ukrainians can rebuild their lives in a stable and secure country, while maintaining its sovereignty and territorial integrity in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations. ",premise
We urge the parties to fully implement the Minsk agreements ,claim
We furthermore recall that in Minsk all parties agreed to allow the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to monitor and verify the ceasefire. ,premise
"We emphasize our support for the OSCE'S Special Monitoring Mission in Ukraine and urge the parties to cooperate with its mandate, particularly through support for the delivery of humanitarian aid. ",claim
the situation there has deteriorated significantly. ,claim
"On 24 January, Russian-backed terrorists committed another heinous crime against humanity. ",premise
"As a result of the shelling of residential areas in Mariupol, in eastern Ukraine, 30 civilians were killed and more than 100 wounded. ",premise
"According to the 24 January spot report of the Special Monitoring Mission in Ukraine of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the bombardment was carried out using multiple Grad and Uragan rockets launched from inside terrorist- controlled territory. ",premise
"The shelling of Mariupol began just after statements by one of the terrorist leaders about imminent attacks on Ukrainian cities, as well as a significant increase in inflows of Russian armed forces and weapons into the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. ",premise
"As the President of Ukraine stated,  ""The bloody murder of dozens of civilians and injuries to almost 100 people by pro-Russian terrorists in Mariupol not only constitute a terrorist attack, they are a crime against humanity, and thus an issue to be considered by the tribunal in The Hague"". ",premise
"it is highly regretful that one of the permanent members of the Security Council, bestowed by the Charter of the United Nations with the primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security, has once again showed its utter disrespect, not only of the Charter but of human values, ",claim
by blocking the Council's condemnation of the heinous crimes against humanity committed by terrorists in Mariupol. ,premise
"Today's statement delivered by the Russian delegation made it sound as if it were not Russia that invaded, occupied and annexed a part of the Ukrainian sovereign territory of Crimea last spring. ",claim
The Russian delegation's statement today made it sound as if regular Russian troops were not in Ukrainian sovereign territory. ,claim
"On can find additional evidence on my Mission's website, which we will try to send to Council members as well. ",premise
If militants and Russia had complied with the Minsk agreements ,premise
this tragedy - the most dreadful since the beginning of the Russian aggression - would not have happened. ,claim
Radio and telephone conversations intercepted by the Security Service of Ukraine irrefutably indicate that the attack was organized by terrorists supported by Russia. ,premise
"Further evidence of that is Russia's blocking of a draft statement by the Security Council condemning this horrible event, as well as its complete silence not a single word of reproach - about the terrorists' other barbaric acts in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, such as the attack on Volnovakha, the shameful behaviour with regard to Ukrainian hostages, the tragedy at the trolleybus stop in Donetsk and many other cases. ",premise
"Therefore, the Russian Federation, which continues to support terrorist activities and whose troops are directly involved in hostilities against Ukraine, is solely responsible for the murders in recent weeks of innocent civilians in Volnovakha, Debaltsevo, Donetsk, Mariupol and many other towns and villages in Ukraine. ",claim
"We seek international support so that Russia is finally compelled to keep its promises, rein in its proxies and stop sending troops and weaponry into Ukraine. ",claim
"We demand that Russia fully implement the Minsk agreements, which it has thus far supported in words only, including the immediate withdrawal of all its armed forces from the territory of Ukraine, the stabilization of the Ukrainian-Russian border and the establishment of international monitoring. ",claim
"It should also free without any further delay Ukrainian pilot Nadiya Savchenko - who is still on a hunger strike that is endangering her life - as well as Oleg Sentsov, Alexander Kolchenko and the other Ukrainian citizens who are being held in Russia illegally. ",claim
We call on the international community to respond resolutely to the crimes of terrorists and to increase all forms of pressure on those who sponsor and support them. ,claim
Our position remains constant: the so-called Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic must be recognized as terrorist organizations. ,claim
"Time and again, we have called on the Security Council to finally exercise its responsibilities under the Charter of the United Nations so as to prevent these terrorist groups from committing their crimes. ",premise
The only way to do that is to put an end to the Russian aggression against Ukraine. ,claim
"Today, as never before, we need joint decisive actions by the international community against terrorist organizations and those who control them. ",claim
"Let me summarize my statement with the words of our President:  ""We stand for peace, but we accept the enemy's challenge. ",claim
We will defend our homeland as true patriots. ,claim
"We will do everything to stop the pain and suffering, to return peace to each Ukrainian family - from Lviv to Luhansk, from Chernihiv to Kerch. ",claim
"Having united our efforts, we will defend our freedom."" ",claim
he has really misstated the position of the Russian Federation. ,claim
"First, we always condemn all attacks on all civilians, and we mourn the deaths of all civilians. ",premise
This is quite different from the authorities in Kyiv ,claim
who say they mourn the deaths of civilians but clearly indicate which civilians and from which regions. ,premise
The fact that hundreds of individuals are dying from Ukrainian rockets and snipers does not interest them. ,premise
They continue to View Donbas as Ukrainian territory. ,premise
"Secondly, we always condemn the deaths of innocent people, and we stood ready to do so in the case of Mariupol as well. ",premise
"The fact that we were not able to do so was the result of the sloppy diplomacy conducted by a number of our colleagues using methods they have resorted to in the past with respect to the Ukrainian crisis, when they have come up with wording that is quite clearly unacceptable to one member of the Security Council. ",premise
Have they ever condemned the inhumane statements that we hear from the authorities in Kyiv? ,claim
Not once. ,claim
Why is it that they all fixate on the statements of one leader of the self-defence formations and insist that we have to condemn them? ,claim
It is quite clear that we are not acting fairly here ,claim
"a statement condemning what happened in Mariupol would have been adopted injust a few minutes, just as we adopted a statement condemning what took place in Volnovakha, which we immediately agreed to. ",premise
"Thirdly, we have always been in favour of objective investigations in such cases. ",premise
one does not want to bring to the Security Council the work of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Special Monitoring Mission. ,premise
it seems to us that the members of the Monitoring Mission did not act appropriately. ,claim
"The members of the Mission, which included individuals from the United States, took a look the site of the tragedy in a very cursory way and then immediately came up with a statement. ",premise
That runs counter to the traditional and agreed methods of work of the OSCE. ,premise
in this situation we see a case in which tragic events have clearly been exploited for political ends. ,claim
I remind Council members that Donbas has been shelled for months by Ukrainian rockets and artillery. ,premise
it is quite clear that we cannot expect conciliatory statements from the leaders of the Donetsk People's Republic. ,claim
They have been trying for month to push the rockets and artillery of the Ukrainian forces back far enough so that they could not threaten Donetsk and Luhansk. ,premise
"That, too, is a goal of the Minsk agreements and underscores the importance of implementing them. ",claim
Ukrainian tanks cannot simply move into Donbas. ,claim
"that was part of the Poroshenko peace plan, which, in essence, demanded the capitulation of the self-defence formations. ",premise
That was the first step towards escalating the conflict into a catastrophe. ,claim
That is unacceptable ,claim
we have recently seen it being pushed by certain members of the Security Council. ,claim
That is the entirely wrong approach. ,claim
Serious political efforts need to be undertaken right now. ,claim
Direct dialogue between Kyiv and the east need to be set up. ,claim
"It is necessary to put an end to the game of hide-and-seek with the Constitution, which needs to be discussed at a all-Ukraine level. ",claim
"I am not familiar with the fact that Russia had agreed to a change in the format, but as far as I know Moscow is very flexible when it comes to the format. ",claim
We stand ready to work in any format that would have a chance of yielding genuine progress in favour of a settlement. ,claim
"no discussion regarding one format or another should serve as a pretext to move away from direct dialogue between Kyiv and the representatives of the regions, first and foremost the east. ",claim
"Ukraine has always presented facts and figures, confirmed not only by other national competent authorities, but also by many independent observers and missions of international organizations on the ground. ",premise
"Today, we also have a list of questions on the 16 battalions and other groups. ",premise
I urge the Council to compare the figures. ,premise
"At the last Council meeting (see S/PV.7365), 9,000 Russian troops were mentioned. ",premise
"Today, we have calculated that there are around 12,000 troops, 235 tanks, 720 armoured combat vehicles and 263 artillery systems. ",premise
"What we have heard instead from the Russian representative in the Council today is nothing but the old, arid and constantly repeated magic mantra - fictions about coup d'etats, Bandera and Shukhevych fascists, anti-Semites, oppression of the Russian language, ignoring the rights of the Donbas population, and so on. ",premise
But not even once have Ukraine and the world received even a briefand meaningful message ofcondolence from Russia for the victims killed by its own mercenaries in Mariupol or Volnovakha. ,premise
"Instead, we see how Russia helps the Russian-speaking population of Donbas: by exterminating it with Grad shelling. ",premise
I call again on the Russian Federation not to play with words or to turn Council deliberations into theatre. ,claim
We have a lot of proof of its direct and indirect aggression in Ukraine. ,premise
Russia is a sponsor of terrorism in Ukraine. ,claim
We advise Russia to stop and to do what was agreed in Minsk. ,claim
I am just stunned by the fact that he has forgotten his Russian ,claim
because only a few moments ago I explained the thrust of the problem facing the east. ,premise
"Instead of simply accepting that and building a political position based on it, we hear the same old propaganda. ",claim
"we intend to closely cooperate, with full confidence, with our German friends in this body in the months to come. ",claim
"They know that they can count on our full support in the implementation of their programme of work, which is rightly focused on the issues he mentioned, including the relaunching of dialogue, the rebuilding of trust and the restoration of security. ",claim
"The crisis unfolding today in eastern Ukraine is one of the most serious and dangerous violations of the founding principles ofthe OSCE, as adopted in Helsinki more than 40 years ago. ",claim
The OSCE has risen to the challenge and shouldered its responsibilities by deploying swiftly a Special Monitoring Mission and playing a central role in the implementation of the Minsk agreements. ,premise
The OSCE must continue to play this core role in the context of the international efforts aimed at resolving the crisis. ,claim
"Our goal here remains a return of control for Ukraine across its internationally recognized borders, which includes reinstating its authority over Crimea. ",claim
"Our position on this issue, which is in keeping with international law, will not change. ",claim
We welcome the fact that the mandate of the Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine was extended several days ago for an additional year upon the initiative of the German chairmanship. ,claim
"For France, resolving the Ukrainian crisis remains a priority ",premise
"We are determined to continue our efforts in the Normandy format to ensure the full implementation of the Minsk agreements, which represents the only possible framework to achieve a peaceful settlement. ",premise
"we are deeply worried about the ongoing Violations of the ceasefire, whose number has increased in recent weeks, and we deplore the piecemeal application of the Minsk agreements on the ground. ",claim
The Minsk agreements are an international commitment whose provisions must be implemented by all parties. ,claim
"This includes the effective implementation of the ceasefire, which is the only possible basis for moving forward, as well as the implementation of the other measures planned for by the Minsk framework, namely, the adoption of a constitutional reform on decentralization and a special electoral law for Donbas, given the fact that the definition of a political horizon is the only way to ensure that the security situation remains stable. ",premise
"This will be a crucial time with respect to our mediation and to the conflict, and all parties must shoulder their responsibilities. ",premise
We call upon other members of the Council to urgently convey this message. ,claim
"We once again call for respect of the freedom of movement of the monitors and firmly condemn any violation of that principle, be it through intimidation, threats or prohibition of access to certain areas. ",claim
We should also think about how to give the organization the ability to better monitor the border between Russia and Ukraine and to set up a new advance presence in areas currently under separatist control. ,claim
"The commitment of the OSCE to ensuring security for local elections in Donbas will also be necessary, on the basis of arrangements yet to be determined. ",claim
the OSCE remains a key instrument for promoting peace and security in Europe in a context characterized by a broad spectrum of threats. ,premise
"This situation should encourage its 57 members to give up political posturing and embrace once again the Helsinki spirit of which Minister Steinmeier just spoke, which enabled a shared vision of security in Europe and which was reiterated in the 2010 Astana commemorative declaration of Heads of State and Government, entitled ""Towards a security community"", based on the three well-known dimensions on which the organization focuses. ",claim
we believe that the work of the OSCE must today emphasize the following issues in particular. ,claim
"Beyond the Ukrainian crisis, we cannot accept the continued existence of frozen conflicts throughout Europe, be it in Nagorno Karabakh, Transdniestria or Georgia, which was mentioned earlier. ",claim
"We share the belief of the German chairmanship that the OSCE's role is key in all of these situations, within established mediation formats, so as to promote dialogue and re-establish confidence. ",claim
Conflict prevention is an issue on which we deem it not only possible but also urgent to make headway together. ,premise
"we welcome the decision of the German chairmanship to attach priority importance to arms control and the adoption of confidence-building measures during this year, in which important timelines are coming up with respect to the Vienna Document and the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe. ",claim
we are nevertheless concerned at the increasing tendency on the part of certain members to politicize or even reject consideration of issues related to the human dimension. ,claim
"The approach taken by the German chairmanship of relaunching work in this area while focusing on issues such as combating discrimination, racism, xenophobia and intolerance is welcome, on the understanding that such work cannot overshadow the efforts that must be made in the area of democracy and human rights. ",claim
"With regard to developing the central role of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to certain emerging challenges a I am thinking in particular about migration, combatting radicalization and even climate change f it is important with all of those issues, which are so important for European security, that the OSCE work towards specific responses beyond public posturing. ",premise
"We fully support the desire of the German chairmanship to encourage the Organization to focus on those areas of expertise, such as in the fight against human trafficking in the context of migration, for example. ",claim
Particular attention should be paid to the impact of climate change on security. ,claim
"Whether it be in the field or in their respective missions in the Balkans, the Caucasus or Central Asia, they must always act in an integrated manner. ",claim
"There is also common ground in terms of principles with the defence of a common approach that encompasses security, development and human rights. ",claim
France is convinced that the founding principles of the OSCE remain more relevant than ever to guarantee security in Europe. ,claim
we think that it important to collectively mobilize to ensure those principles are upheld. ,claim
"Like the United Nations, the OSCE was founded on the principles of dialogue and respect for peace and stability. ",premise
"Together, the two organizations are therefore at the forefront of the rules-based international system. ",claim
that system is seldom left unchallenged ,premise
"so it is incumbent upon both organizations to work closely together to advance peace and security, and in doing so to uphold the Charter of the United Nations and the Helsinki principles. ",claim
"I wish to reaffirm the United Kingdom's full support for Ukraine's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity and our commitment to the return of Crimea to its rightful place as part of Ukraine. ",claim
"One year since our previous meeting on the OSCE (see S/PV.7391), can we really say that the overall situation has changed for the better in the east of Ukraine? ",premise
"That meeting focused on the regular breaches of the ceasefire, the use of heavy weapons and the continued presence ofconvoys crossing the international border. ",premise
To that list one can now add the unacceptable aggression directed against OSCE monitors. ,premise
"I am saddened and deeply worried to say that, one year later, we seem no closer to a resolution of the crisis. ",claim
"Since the crisis began, over 9,000 people have lost their lives, and over 3 million are now in need of humanitarian assistance. ",premise
It is clear that that toll will only continue to grow unless a truly sustainable ceasefire is put in place and all sides meet their Minsk commitments in full. ,claim
"To that end, three clear steps must be taken. ",claim
"First, it is imperative that the Monitoring Mission, ably directed by Ambassador Apakan, be permitted to carry out its mandate in full. ",claim
The threats and aggressive behaviour towards monitors must end. ,claim
"The Mission must have unrestricted access to all of Ukraine, especially those parts of the border with Russia not under Ukraine's control. ",claim
"The Russian Federation should use its influence on the separatists to ensure that that happens without delay, as they it is obliged to do. ",claim
"Secondly, while there have been some welcome exchanges of prisoners over the last year, at least 134 Ukrainian prisoners remain in detention. ",premise
"We again call on Russia to release all illegally detained Ukrainian citizens, including those held in Russia and in the illegally annexed Crimean peninsula. ",claim
Those include Nadiya Savchenko and Oleg Sentsov. ,claim
"We also reiterate that all hostages and illegally detained persons related to the crisis in and around Ukraine must be released, as stipulated under the Minsk agreements. ",claim
"Thirdly, even more important, what is most needed is a truly sustainable ceasefire and genuine political will to restore Ukrainian sovereignty. ",claim
The Russian Federation must demonstrate that will and live up to its international commitments. ,claim
It must withdraw its weapons and personnel and use its considerable influence over the separatists to bring an end to the crisis and prevent the deaths of more people. ,claim
That is the best way to end the fear and suffering of ordinary people in eastern Ukraine and to allow the Ukrainian Government to focus on much-needed programmes of governance and reform. ,premise
"Until those steps are taken, we will be working with our European Union partners to ensure that sanctions remain in place. ",premise
"The onus is on Russia to demonstrate a clear commitment to act in line with the principles that guide the OSCE, the Council and other international organizations. ",claim
"Finally, beyond Ukraine, we in the Security Council should not lose sight of the need to work closely with the German OSCE chairmanship to resolve other issues affecting the region. ",claim
"Those include protecting fundamental freedoms, which continue to come under growing pressure in some OSCE States, addressing the need for greater military transparency and tackling the protracted conflicts that continue to blight the lives of people across the OSCE region, most notably in Georgia. ",claim
"We need dialogue based on respect for, and the implementation of, commitments. ",claim
"Without that we face continuing deadlock, which is damaging and debilitating to all sides. ",premise
Russian actions in Ukraine cast a shadow over efforts to build confidence and security across OSCE States. ,premise
"We must lift that shadow and, as Foreign Minister Steinmeier said, rebuild trust, renew dialogue and restore security. ",claim
"Angola needs a Europe in peace, marked by stability and growing economies. ",premise
"We therefore attach great relevance to the programme set by the German chairmanship of the OSCE, focused on the fight against threats such as terrorism, radicalism, drug trafficking, as well as on countering the abuse of cyberspace, by addressing youth radicalization through a comprehensive approach to security and the efforts that it has been deploying to address today's growing security challenges. ",claim
Angola supports and appreciates the OSCE's outstanding role in that regard. ,claim
"the organization's efforts to strengthen dialogue and cooperation in areas such as arms control are of relevance, as are initiatives aimed at managing cross-border movements and the social and political impact of migration, based on the organization's commitment to human rights and the promotion of tolerance and non-discrimination, ",claim
which are solid foundations for lasting solutions to the critical problems affecting the international community. ,premise
We welcome the German chairmanship's objective of holding a conference on those issues later this year in Berlin. ,claim
"we praise the OSCE's active support to the current negotiations and mechanisms for solving conflicts in Nagorno Karabakh and to the Transnistria talks on Georgia, as well as its fundamental role in the stabilization of Kosovo and in monitoring the Minsk agreement on eastern Ukraine. ",claim
Angola values with great appreciation the contribution of regional and subregional organizations to the maintenance of international peace and security. ,claim
"They play a key role in strengthening the multilateral system and complement the work of the United Nations through the specific knowledge of their respective regions, particularly with regard to the root causes of conflict. ",premise
"we would like to stress the importance of dialogue between the Security Council and the OSCE, as well as with other international, regional and subregional organizations, in prevention and crisis management and tackling issues that are threats to regional peace and stability in Europe. ",claim
"China commends the OSCE for its efforts and welcomes the priorities defined by the German chairmanship for enhancing dialogue, rebuilding mutual trust and restoring security. ",claim
"We hope that the OSCE shall continue to play its constructive role in maintaining regional peace, security and stability. ",claim
"China consistently advocates for political solutions to regional hotspot issues through dialogue and negotiation, and supports regional and subregional organizations in conducting preventive diplomacy, defusing differences and settling conflicts by peaceful means so as to contribute to the promotion of regional peace and security. ",claim
"The activities of regional organizations should conform to the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations, in particular the principle of respect for the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of all countries. ",claim
The Security Council and regional and subregional organizations have their respective advantages in maintaining international peace and security. ,premise
"The United Nations and the Security Council should, in accordance with the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations, continue to deepen cooperation with regional and subregional organizations so as to be mutually complementary in their efforts to jointly uphold the Charter and the basic principles guiding international relations. ",claim
The OSCE is an important partner of the United Nations. ,claim
The overall situation in eastern Ukraine is relatively calm. ,claim
"All relevant parties, including the OSCE, have made positive efforts in this process. ",premise
"A comprehensive settlement of the Ukraine issue must follow the general direction of a political solution, taking fully into account the legitimate rights, interests and demands of all regions and ethnic groups within Ukraine, while paying due attention to the legitimate concerns of all relevant parties. ",claim
"China supports all relevant parties in fully implementing the Minsk agreement, as called for in resolution 2202 (2015), and in continuously advancing a political solution to the Ukraine issue. ",claim
"The international community should enable the Normandy and Minsk mediation mechanisms to play their full roles and jointly advance the early achievement of peace, calm, stability and development in Ukraine. ",claim
"We have consistently stood for developing and improving cooperation between the United Nations and regional and subregional mechanisms on the basis of the Charter of the United Nations, first and foremost Chapter VIII. ",claim
It is on this very foundation that cooperation between the United Nations and the OSCE should be based. ,claim
"We share the emphasis of the German chairmanship on the ""all-weather"" dialogue, for which the OSCE has a solid foundation in the form of the genuine equality of all States parties and a broad-based agenda, which reflects the interests of all. ",claim
in the OSCE not a single State or bloc of States can freeze matters of common interest and of paramount importance for European security. ,premise
"There are collective means of crisis management, which enjoy high credibility in the region. ",claim
That must remain the OSCE's philosophy of dialogue in the future. ,claim
"Unfortunately, the ideals that were at the heart of the creation of the organization have not always been implemented in practice, nor has cooperation between States become a key rallying factor. ",premise
"Sometimes, one has the impression that geopolitical egoism or a narrowness of political thinking has the upper hand. ",premise
"Who would have thought that in the heart of Europe there could have been such a violent armed coup d'etat as took place in Ukraine, and even with the support of some members of the OSCE? ",premise
"In that context, the people of Crimea were free to decide to join Russia. ",claim
"The instruments that were proposed by the OSCE to settle the crisis, including the Swiss road map, remained on the table, ",claim
first and foremost due to Kyiv's lack of desire to seek a solution based on an inclusive dialogue to solve the conflict with different regions and to a lack of good political leadership. ,premise
The agenda was imposed by radicals. ,premise
"That is the reason not only for the complete disarray in the economic and political life of Ukraine, but also of Kyiv's failure to implement a number of key provisions of the package of measures agreed upon in Minsk by the leaders of Normandy quartet and endorsed in resolution 2202 (2015). ",claim
We believe that one of the primary tasks for the German chairmanship of the OSCE should be the full implementation of the package of measures. ,claim
"it is quite convenient that Germany is also an active member of Normandy format, and indeed, thanks to its international prestige, Germany has given the package of measures more weight. ",claim
the OSCE has neither the political nor the moral right to lose sight of the investigation of the tragedy on the Maidan in February 2014 and in Odessa on 2 May 2014. ,claim
"We called attention to the brash assertion of certain participants at the events in the Maidan, recently widely publicized in Ukraine, who openly acknowledged that they were the instigators of killings of law enforcement officers, who, unarmed, were ensuring public order in the capital of Ukraine in those days. ",premise
"No charges have been levied against them, nor are investigations under way. ",claim
We cannot indulge in their impunity. ,claim
We think that the current format of cooperation between the United Nations and the OSCE in Ukraine is sufficient. ,claim
"We base this on the fact that the parties themselves have the primary responsibility for implementing the practical solutions to stabilize the situation - demining, rehabilitation of infrastructure, exchange of prisoners and so on. ",premise
"It is important to recall the dangers of attempts to blur or reinterpret the existing mechanisms, such as the Contact Group or the Normandy format, and to launch new initiatives that only distract us from the necessity to fully implement the package of measures. ",claim
we support the activities of the OSCE Monitoring Mission in Ukraine. ,claim
"We believe that monitors could pay more attention to monitoring on the territory under the control of the Ukrainian army - in particular the Dnepropetrovsk, Kharkov and Zaporozhye regions, where armaments and equipment are being accumulated - and provide more complete reporting on their activities. ",claim
the OSCE Monitoring Mission in Ukraine is the only mechanism that can work with all parties to the conflict: Kyiv and Donetsk and Luhansk. ,claim
"It is of the utmost importance that the monitoring activities be carried out in a manner that is equal on both sides ofthe line of contact, and not concentrated mainly in the territories under the control of the militias. ",claim
"mistrust arises on the part of Luhansk and Donetsk, which in particular is then reflected in the problems of access by monitors to sites in the republics. ",claim
An important element in establishing a global unifying agenda is strengthening the OSCE as a format for dialogue and cooperation with regard to transnational threats and challenges. ,premise
We support the efforts of the German chairmanship in that regard. ,claim
It would be advisable to conduct a joint assessment of threats to common security. ,claim
"We believe that the OSCE can contribute to the response to the migration crisis, which requires in-depth discussion. ",claim
"On the military-political front, a common understanding of shared goals in arms control and confidence-building measures is needed. ",claim
"But for this one needs to overcome the logic of containment, a mode of thinking again prevailing among NATO strategists. ",premise
We recognize the relevance ofincluding an item on sustainable connectivity on the agenda of economic and environmental baskets. ,claim
Harmonizing and calibrating the integration processes in Europe and Eurasia are designed to reduce the potential for conflict on the continent. ,premise
We think that the upcoming business conference in Berlin on economic connectivity on 18 and 19 May will allow progress on that path. ,claim
"The humanitarian dimension of the OSCE should be depoliticized, cleansed of double standards. ",claim
"Russian priorities in that regard are well-known - the protection of universal traditional values; countering aggressive nationalism, radicalism and neo-Nazism; preventing attempts to falsify the history of the Second World War; the fight against ethnic and religious intolerance, including against Christians; and the protection of journalists working in conflict zones. ",claim
"Ensuring the rights of children and the disabled, non-intervention in private life and agreement on common rules for monitoring elections are among other topics that the OSCE should pay more attention to. ",claim
"The whole spectrum of social, economic and cultural rights require equal attention. ",claim
I would like to express Ukraine's support for the priorities for 2016 of Germany's Chairperson-in-Office of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). ,claim
We particularly commend Germany's determination to focus its efforts on practical responses to the grave threats to security in the OSCE's area of operations. ,claim
The Russian aggression against Ukraine in Crimea and the Donbas region remains at the top of that list. ,claim
"Due to necessity rather than any choice of ours, the issue of that aggression will continue to be at the centre ofthe OSCE's attention. ",claim
"Ukraine fully shares and supports the German chairmanship's motto - ""Renewing dialogue, rebuilding trust, restoring security"". ",premise
It is a very accurate description of what is needed for the situation not just within the OSCE's purview but all over the world. ,claim
"Instead of dialogue, we frequently witness bitter exchanges of mutual accusations. ",premise
"These days, instead ofa climate of trust, an overriding sense of mutual suspicion sets the tone in international politics. ",premise
"Instead of having a sense of secrity and confidence, States increasingly feel threatened in the current environment of systematic violations of international law, including the Charter of the United Nations, and of a lack of international instruments adequate to holding the perpetrators of such violations to account. ",premise
"Under the circumstances of these difficult times, Germany's commitment to leading the OSCE is highly commendable. ",claim
The German chairmanship has set itself an ambitious and noble task. ,claim
The Security Council is vested with the primary responsibility for maintaining international peace and security. ,premise
one can hardly avoid noticing that the dominant trend is worsening. ,claim
"The growing potential for conflict across the globe is shaping our new security reality, and one permanent member of the Security Council has repeatedly resorted over the past decade to the most problematic area of that reality - armed aggression against neighbouring States in Europe that has resulted in occupation and, even more alarmingly, in the attempted annexation of part of the territory of another country, the first such attempt since the Second World War. ",premise
"We have all been dealing with the Russian hybrid war against Ukraine, which is marked by the invention of artificial grounds for invasion, the deployment of regular troops without insignia and the use ofpervasive, virulent propaganda. ",premise
That has led to the illegal occupation of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol and the plunging of the Donbas region into a bloody conflict. ,claim
"Ukraine, like other European States, also has to counter regular attempts to destabilize its internal situation. ",claim
"The overall style of such subversive activities is recognizable through its use of similar tools such as marginal nationalist forces operating under pseudo-patriotic slogans, including, in the countries of the European Union, those voicing anti-immigrant sentiments. ",premise
I have to express our deep concern about the fact that the situation in Donbas remains fragile and prone to escalation ,premise
Ukraine's efforts to implement the Minsk agreements have not been reciprocated in Russia. ,claim
"Moscow still relies on the pseudo-republics it has manufactured as a tool that may be activated at any time the Kremlin considers expedient, including by triggering new phases of conflict. ",premise
the Minsk agreements remain the agreed basis for a peaceful resolution to the situation in Donbas. ,claim
"Since the initial documents were signed, in September 2014, we have regularly initiated steps aimed at silencing the weapons there. ",premise
"It is profoundly regrettable that, a year after the Minsk package of measures was agreed on, its initial security provisions have yet to be implemented by Russia and its proxies. ",claim
"We are ready to fully implement the agreements and move forward with all aspects, including holding local elections in various areas of Donbas, which must be conducted in accordance with Ukrainian legislation and OSCE standards in order to produce legitimate regional representatives. ",claim
"Our constitutional reform and decentralization will encompass the elected representatives and provide them with powers, responsibility and accountability. ",premise
What we need in order to move forward is a solid security foundation ,claim
"and in particular a comprehensive and sustainable ceasefire, the verified withdrawal of heavy weapons and unfettered monitoring by the OSCE throughout the conflict area, including at the border with Russia. ",premise
"As progress on the security track is long overdue, we need to take decisive steps to establish the security conditions necessary for a peaceful settlement in Donbas. ",claim
"What is required is a genuine disengagement line rather than a contact line, with weapons effectively withdrawn, armed provocations by militants rendered impossible and an enhanced international presence capable of ensuring security on the ground, in addition to the monitoring and verification functions that the OSCE's Special Monitoring Mission currently performs. ",claim
enhancing the OSCE capacities on the ground and reinforcing them with a special police mission under the auspices of the OSCE could become an effective tool in bringing peace to Donbas. ,claim
"It is evident that the uncontrolled segment of the Ukrainian-Russian border makes the impact of all international efforts on de-escalation very limited, as replenishments to the illegal armed groups with weapons and manpower from Russia continue. ",premise
"As an agreed initial step until Ukrainian border guards resume control at the border, permanent monitoring and verification by the OSCE along all border sections of concern from both sides ofthe border should be ensured, as stipulated by the Minsk protocol of September 2014, also signed by Russia. ",claim
"The release of all hostages and illegally detained persons, including Ukrainian political prisoners in Russia, will be a crucial benchmark for assessing Russia's readiness to embark on the de-escalation path. ",claim
"It is one of the few provisions of the Minsk agreement that contains a very specific timeframe, for apparent humanitarian reasons, that is, within five days of the withdrawal of heavy weapons from the contact line. ",premise
"About two years ago Russia launched its aggression against Ukraine in Crimea, trampling fundamental international norms and principles, including those enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and the Helsinki Final Act. ",claim
"the strong international condemnation proves that the issue of the illegally occupied peninsula is firmly on the agenda, whatever Russia claims. ",claim
"I am absolutely convinced that an international framework to address the Crimean case will be established sooner or later, as that is the only way to guarantee the full relevance of international law. ",claim
Restoring respect for the fundamental norms and principles of our peaceful coexistence and cooperation and seeking their proper implementation are in the interests of both the United Nations and the OSCE. ,claim
"Today, the principles and commitments embodied by the OSCE face some serious challenges, both from inside and outside the organization. ",claim
"From within, there is an uneven application of the Helsinki norms, principles and commitments, where some States are re-exerting a sphere of influence at the expense of other States, while, from without, regional crises and transnational threats are proliferating. ",premise
"Efforts to resolve the conflict in Ukraine and the protracted conflicts in Moldova, Georgia and Nagorno Karabakh continue to face very frustrating obstacles. ",premise
"We commend the Chairperson-in-Office's efforts in support of resolving the crisis in Ukraine, including his leadership in obtaining an extension of the mandate of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine through 31 March 2017. ",claim
The roles of both the OSCE Monitoring Mission and the Trilateral Contact Group are essential to restoring peace to Ukraine ,claim
"the full implementation of the Minsk agreements, including the ceasefire and weapons pullback, is critical. ",claim
The Monitoring Mission and also plays a critical role in assessing the humanitarian situation on the ground and facilitating the delivery of much-needed humanitarian aid. ,claim
The increase in violence along the line of contact in eastern Ukraine is of enormous concern ,claim
the worst since the ceasefire declaration of 1 September 2015. ,premise
OSCE monitoring reports indicate that the number of ceasefire violations continues to rise ,premise
"onjust one day, 24 February, monitors registered nearly 850 explosions and firing of small and heavy weapons. ",premise
The OSCE has also documented the movement of heavy weapons out of designated storage sites and placed in areas off-limits under the Minsk agreements ,premise
"Russian-backed separatists do not allow OSCE observers full access to all areas to monitor and verify the maintenance of the ceasefire, the withdrawal of heavy weapons and the presence of foreign fighters. ",claim
Russian-backed separatist forces have repeatedly barred the Monitoring Mission from inspecting heavy weapons storage sites. ,claim
"the separatist routinely denied the Mission access to the Ukrainian- Russian border, while Russia unilaterally blocks the expansion of the OSCE border observation mission beyond the two current small checkpoints. ",claim
movement restrictions on the Special Monitoring Mission often go hand-in-hand with weapons Violations and have overwhelmingly occurred on the separatist side of the line of contact. ,premise
the separatists continue to make direct threats against the Mission itself. ,claim
"On 15 February, near Kominternove, they once again threatened to shoot Mission members, which is the third such incident since January. ",premise
"The United States reiterates its call on Russia to direct the separatists it supports and supplies to immediately honour the ceasefire, withdraw heavy weapons visibly and verifiably, return those weapons to their designated storage sites and end restrictions on the movements and activities of the Monitoring Mission. ",claim
The United States strongly supports the OSCE's efforts to support a peaceful resolution of long-standing conflicts ,claim
such as its mission to broker a comprehensive settlement to the Transnistria conflict by facilitating direct dialogue between the sides and by supporting confidence-building measures. ,premise
"But in Transnistria, like in Donbas, local so-called authorities refuse to grant OSCE monitors unfettered access to do their important work. ",claim
"The United States calls for unrestricted access for the OSCE Mission to Moldova throughout the country, including the Transnistrian region, so that it can perform its activities and fulfil its mandate. ",claim
The OSCE continues its dedicated support of a negotiated settlement ofthe Nagorno Karabakh conflict. ,claim
violence along the line of contact and the Armenia-Azerbaijan State border has escalated over the past several months. ,claim
The United States condemns the use of mortars and other heavy weaponry ,claim
which have caused civilian casualties ,premise
and appeals to the sides to take immediate steps to reduce tensions and protect lives. ,claim
The status quo is neither acceptable nor sustainable. ,premise
We remind the sides that there can be no military solution to this conflict. ,claim
"The United States fully supports Georgia's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity. ",claim
We urge the Russian Government to withdraw its troops to pre-war positions and allow humanitarian agencies and the European Union Monitoring Mission unfettered access in the occupied territories there. ,claim
As a participant in the Geneva international discussions along with the OSCE and the United Nations ,premise
the United States remains committed to working with the parties and the other Chairs to improve the security and humanitarian situation for all residents of Georgia affected by the conflict. ,claim
There is an immediate need for coordinated response to the migration and refugee crisis in the OSCE region and beyond. ,claim
Addressing the impact of the large numbers of migrants arriving in Europe requires rights-based responses to the challenges of migration ,premise
"including by prioritizing respect for the human rights of migrants, refugees and asylum seekers, and by developing the capacity of Governments to integrate new arrivals and counter anti-migrant sentiment, xenophobia and hate crimes. ",premise
"the OSCE's role in support of the global effort to address weapons proliferation, including through implementation of resolution 1540 (2004), is critical. ",claim
We strongly support the commitment of the OSCE to strengthen member States' commitments to implementing the provisions of resolution 1325 (2000) ,claim
in order to increase the role of women in peacemaking and peacebuilding and to end violence against women in conflict. ,premise
"The fundamental commitments of the OSCE have provided clarity, stability and continuity to participating States for more than 35 years in our common effort to promote comprehensive security throughout the Euro- Atlantic and Eurasian regions. ",premise
We must all continue to implement our mutual commitments. ,claim
We value the deepening cooperation and coordination between the United Nations and the OSCE to that end. ,claim
I agree with the statement made by the representative of the United States. ,claim
he quite rightly noted that one of the most important principles of the OSCE is the equality of all members before international law. ,claim
We fully agree with that ,claim
deem it unacceptable that there have been statements made on the right of certain States to determine the fate of the rest of the world. ,premise
Another issue that was rightly noted by the United States representative and with which we agree is the danger posed by a return to the principle of spheres of influence. ,claim
We are critical of the expansion of NATO into the east and of how the European Union continues to formulate its policy of Eastern partnership. ,claim
Eastern European States are given the choice to be either with the West or with the East. ,premise
the crisis in Ukraine broke out as a result of the fact that Brussels began to categorically demand that president Yanukovych immediately sign the agreement on association with the European Union. ,premise
Therefore a return to the policy of the spheres of influence is extremely undermining in terms of consequences for European security. ,claim
Yet another element on which I fully agree with the representative of the United States is the continuing dangerous situation in terms of security between the Kyiv armed forces and rebel battalions that are continuing to operate in eastern Ukraine and Donetsk and Luhansk. ,claim
to a large extent this exacerbation is due to the fact that the Ukrainian armed forces took over a neutral space and began to defend a security zone there with heavy weaponry. ,premise
This runs totally counter to the logic and the letter of the Minsk agreements ,claim
which speak of the need for the withdrawal of forces. ,premise
"The Ukrainian forces are coming dangerously close to the armed groups, which has led to exchanges of fire and attacks. ",claim
"I cannot but express my disappointment at the statement made by my Ukrainian colleague, who repeated several propagandistic slogans with respect to Russia. ",claim
but prospects for agreement on how the elections will be held look rather dim. ,claim
"Indeed, there are difficulties in the context of the Contact Group, so it seems that Kyiv once again is really drawing out the process. ",premise
I should like once again to reiterate the request that our colleagues in the Normandy format have heard. ,claim
We need to be very demanding and act as a matter of principle. ,claim
"When agreements are reached at a high level, Kyiv must be required to implement them. ",claim
the fight against corruption and economic reforms will move forward ,claim
because in a conflict situation it is probably too optimistic to expect some sort of progress on such fronts. ,premise
"So Kyiv first and foremost should want to see the implementation of the package of measures, just as Russia does. ",claim
It is time to put an end to the crisis ,claim
"which would not have begun in the first place had it not been for this undermining policy of spheres of influence, which the United States criticized today. ",claim
I should like to recall that the irreversible political changes that took place in the Caucasus in 2008 ,claim
happened as a result of the aggression that Georgian politicians carried out against southern Ossetia. ,premise
The United States supported them ,premise
"at that time there were more than 100 United States military advisers in Georgia, so it would be naive to think that they turned a blind eye to what was happening or missed it. ",premise
So let us not engage in propaganda but concentrate on the ongoing work in the Caucasus and in Ukraine so as to normalize the situation after those crises ,claim
"which were due to various factors, among which the United States played a rather significant role. ",premise
"The facts remain that Russia backed the separatists, Russia armed the separatists and Russia led a military campaign that led to the purported annexation of Crimea, in Violation of the Charter of the United Nations. ",claim
"these facts remain unchanged, regardless of whatever distractions are offered in the Chamber today. ",claim
It is probably very easy for my Russian colleague to pick a few parts of my statement and react to them. ,claim
that Russia has fulfilled none of its obligations under the Minsk agreements. ,claim
"Let us talk about everything in the Minsk agreements, not only about the constitutional amendments and the elections. ",premise
"Finally, during two years of aggression, a 40,000-strong army has been built up in the Donbas. ",premise
"That army is financed, equipped and maintained by Russia and commanded by Russian officers. ",premise
It has been supplied with sophisticated modern Russian weaponry. ,claim
I have a very long list of weapons that are not and were never produced in Ukraine. ,premise
Those weapons did not just fall from the sky. ,premise
What was Ukraine's response? ,premise
President Poroshenko put forth a peace initiative that provided a week for the capitulation of the citizens of Donbas. ,claim
We immediately responded that there could be no military settlement; there must be a political one. ,claim
The Ukrainians did not want a political settlement ,premise
"they wanted a military one, so they get what they get. ",claim
"If he wants to go into the whole package of measures for the implementation of the Minsk agreements, we can do that, but we have already said these things many times and when everything that is supposed to happen has already been clearly established. ",premise
Border control is supposed to happen last. ,claim
It is all very clear in the package. ,claim
"A special status must be established and other things must be done, which Kyiv simply does not want to do. ",claim
"Unfortunately, some States that have a strong influence on Kyiv - not in the Normandy format, but delegations around the table today - say ""What do you want? ",premise
Ukraine just cannot do it. ,premise
"We know it is written there, but Ukraine cannot do it."" ",premise
"So, the representative of Ukraine cannot raise that question. ",claim
"If he is really talking about a political settlement, there is a need to demand and ensure that Ukraine adopt the laws that were supposed to be adopted under the package. ",premise
Russia cannot do it for Ukraine. ,premise
"Rhetorically, the representative of Ukraine can say whatever he wants, but unfortunately the situation in Ukraine will only deteriorate in that context and nobody will win. ",claim
"Such cooperation must be regular and multifaceted, encompassing all dimensions of security. ",claim
The OSCE is designed to assist United Nations mechanisms in the area of their purview within the framework of its mandate. ,premise
It is important to take into account the comparative advantages of the two organizations and to avoid duplication and the waste of resources. ,claim
"we share its key priorities, aimed at conflict resolution, combatting radicalization and extremism, the restoration of trust among States, and the strengthening of the institutional foundation of the Organization. ",claim
"The OSCE must strive to carry out those functions for which it was created, serving as a platform for equitable dialogue and collective decision-making on security issues. ",claim
"Its focus should be on the fight against terrorism, drug trafficking and cyberthreats; the harmonization of integration processes; support for traditional values and the protection of the rights of national minorities; combatting neo-Nazism; reform of the OSCE, including the development of its charter; and the organization of the electoral monitoring work of the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights. ",claim
"In the area of international security information, the OSCE complements the global United Nations efforts to develop confidence-building measures through the use of information and communications technologies. ",claim
"We take a generally positive view of cooperation between the United Nations and the OSCE in the field, for example, through the OSCE Mission in Kosovo. ",claim
We appreciate their collaboration in the Geneva talks on Transcaucasia ,claim
"which have been an important factor in establishing direct dialogue between Georgia, Abkhazia and South Ossetia. ",premise
"We support the Austrian chairship for its backing of the OSCE's continuing efforts to help settle regional conflicts, and we are willing to cooperate in reaching settlements in Transnistria and Nagorno Karabakh. ",claim
It is to be hoped that 2017 can bring peace and a political solution in eastern Ukraine ,claim
"where the armed conflict, which has now lasted more than three years, continues to take new civilian lives. ",premise
The residents of Donetsk and Luhansk have suffered for their right to freedom and special status Within the Ukrainian State. ,premise
It is vital that full compliance with the Minsk package of measures be finally achieved if we are to grant the region and its inhabitants the possibility of a peaceful life and democratic self-government and to restore their broken economic ties to the rest of Ukraine. ,claim
"All of that is provided for in the Minsk agreement, as adopted in resolution 2202 (2015). ",claim
"we believe that we have a proven and well-established model for settling the conflict in south- eastern Ukraine, one element of which is the OSCE's Special Monitoring Mission in Ukraine. ",claim
We do not see any practical benefits of duplicating the functions of the Special Monitoring Mission through any new types of international structure. ,claim
"We hope that the Austrian chairmanship will continue to keep the Mission's objectivity under control, while giving direction to its representatives in the Trilateral Contact Group and its subgroups on developing a direct dialogue between the parties to the conflict. ",claim
"it is important to act extremely cautiously in this sensitive and delicate process and to bear in mind three key principles - that conflicts must be resolved peacefully, with the direct participation of the parties and respect for their interests, and within existing formats. ",claim
"Russia considers the OSCE to be an important mechanism for building a fair and indivisible security system for Europe as a whole, and is involved in strengthening its role and authority. ",claim
We believe firmly that in order to improve the OSCE's relevance it is essential to clearly define the priorities for its activities and to create a charter for the organization. ,claim
the rule-based system is under threat. ,claim
"It is a threat that we talk about often in this Chamber, but to the residents of cities such as Marinka, in Ukraine, that threat is a horrifying daily reality. ",premise
"For the past three years, the people there have lived in fear, subject to the daily unrelenting dangers that have become the norm on the front line in eastern Ukraine. ",premise
"Residents there speak of daily sniper fire and shelling, and the daily scramble for shelter. ",premise
"For nearly three years, they have survived Without gas supplies in the face of plummeting temperatures every winter. ",premise
Those are the consequences of Russia's violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. ,claim
That is what happens when the rule-based system is attacked. ,claim
"We cannot allow it to become the new normal, and we must use all the tools at our disposal in response. ",claim
It is unacceptable that the Mission continues to be fired on and face restrictions on its access. ,claim
"Such actions, so often perpetrated by the separatists, only fuel suspicions that they are concealing activity that is at odds with the Minsk agreements. ",premise
"I hope, therefore, that we can all be clear today that aggression towards monitors must stop and that the Mission must be given unrestricted access to all of Ukraine, including the disengagement areas and those parts of the border with Russia that are not under Ukraine's control. ",claim
"the long-term solution to the situation in eastern Ukraine requires Russia to end its destabilizing activities in the region, comply with its commitments under the Minsk agreements, withdraw its weapons and personnel, use its considerable influence over the separatists to bring an end to the killing and return Crimea to its rightful place as part of Ukraine. ",claim
"That is the only meaningful path to long-term peace in Ukraine, and until it is taken, the sanctions against Russia must remain in place. ",premise
"Beyond Ukraine, we should not lose sight of the Council's need to work closely with the Austrian chairmanship of the OSCE in resolving other issues affecting the region and in helping to protect fundamental rights and freedoms. ",claim
"Those issues include the protracted conflicts in Abkhazia, South Ossetia, Transnistria and Nagorno Karabakh. ",premise
"We also value the vital role that the OSCE plays in risk reduction in the region, and we welcome the launch of the structured dialogue. ",claim
"We support the Chairperson-in-Office's focus on youth and radicalization, where the OSCE, with its cross-dimensional approach to security, can add real value. ",claim
"If the OSCE is to respond to those and other challenges, we must also continue to strengthen it. ",claim
"One way to do that is through strong appointments, and I am pleased that the United Kingdom has put forward an excellent candidate for the post of OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities, in a sign of our continued commitment to the organization. ",premise
We are also pleased that our Ambassador to the OSCE is chairing the OSCE Human Dimension Committee this year and working closely with the Austrian chairship. ,claim
"In conclusion, events in eastern Ukraine have reinforced just how important the OSCE is to international cooperation. ",claim
The work being done there is vital to the beleaguered residents of Marinka and to all Ukrainians in the eastern part of the country. ,claim
"Sadly, events in Ukraine highlight the threats that countries in the OSCE area, and the rule-based system as a whole, continue to face. ",premise
"If we are to respond to them effectively, we must continue to strengthen the OSCE, and with it the Security Council's cooperation. ",claim
The track record of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) clearly demonstrates the unique and significant role that that organization plays in Europe. ,claim
The United States fully supports the organization's comprehensive approach to security. ,claim
the United States is committed to the institutions that help keep Europe safe (see S/PV.7886). ,premise
We commend the long-standing commitment and ongoing efforts of the OSCE in support of regional security. ,claim
"the OSCE plays a key role in strengthening security and stability, addressing humanitarian needs of conflict- afflicted populations and promoting good governance in the region. ",claim
We believe that the organization should also continue its focus on supporting civil society and independent media and on promoting tolerance and non-discrimination throughout the OSCE region. ,claim
to make the full implementation of all human dimension commitments by all OSCE participating States a priority of his chairmanship. ,claim
The commitment and bravery of the Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine deserves particular recognition. ,claim
"As recent weeks have seen, an increase in violence, including the use of heavy weapons, civilian causalities and damage to critical infrastructure have compounded a desperate humanitarian situation. ",premise
"The Special Monitoring Mission has worked with humanitarian organizations on both sides of the line of contact to ensure that civilians enduring freezing conditions, on top ofthe relentless fighting, have access to heat, water and electricity. ",premise
OSCE monitors risk their own safety to fulfil their mandate to document ceasefire violations and to provide critical information of the situation on the ground. ,premise
They deserve our respect and support as they press all sides to bring an immediate end to violence. ,claim
"They must be granted full and unfettered access and safe passage to better perform their mission, particularly in areas held by Russian-backed separatists. ",claim
We continue to be concerned about threats made to the Special Monitoring Mission and underscore the importance of all sides to protect them and their work in monitoring the situation on the ground. ,claim
The United States continues to support the Minsk agreements and their full and immediate implementation ,claim
as the best path to resolve the conflict and alleviate the suffering in eastern Ukraine. ,premise
This should remain a priority of the OSCE and we reiterate our call on Russia to adhere to its commitments. ,claim
We must not forget the situation in occupied Crimea. ,claim
We once again call for an end to the Russian occupation and attempted annexation of the peninsula. ,claim
The United States remains fully committed to supporting the OSCE's efforts in other areas as well. ,claim
"In Georgia, the OSCE plays a positive role in keeping all sides accountable ",claim
we encourage the Organization to remain actively engaged as the conflict with Russia in Georgia's occupied territories continues to undermind European security. ,claim
"As a participant in the Geneva international discussions, ",premise
the United States looks forward to continuing our work with the OSCE to find a peaceful resolution that guarantees Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders. ,claim
As one of the three co-Chairs of the OSCE Minsk Group ,premise
the United States supports the peaceful settlement of the Nagorno Karabakh conflict. ,claim
The sides have made progress over the years towards a comprehensive settlement through this process. ,claim
We call on the sides to enter into negotiations and complete confidence-building measures agreed last spring. ,claim
This conflict cannot be resolved by force. ,claim
We are firmly committed to a comprehensive settlement of the Transnistria conflict. ,claim
"We believe that the 5+2 talks can play an important role in resolving the conflict, but any 5+2 meeting must deliver concrete results. ",claim
"The OSCE mission must have unrestricted access to all of Moldova, including the Transnistrian region, and we call on the Transnistrian authorities to grant OSCE monitors consistent, unfettered access. ",claim
we would like to highlight the OSCE's vital  role in supporting the implementation of our decisions in the Security Council. ,claim
"The OSCE's support for two Security Council resolutions, in particular resolution 1540 (2004), is part of the global effort to address weapons' proliferation, and resolution 1325 (2000) to end violence against women and ensure women are at the centre of efforts to resolve conflicts and counter violent extremism. ",premise
The world today is filled with various types of challenges. ,premise
"Countries are interdependent, and their security is interconnected. ",premise
"the United Nations is at the core of the international collective-security architecture, ",claim
regional and subregional organizations enjoy unique advantages in resolving hot-spot issues in their respective regions. ,claim
"China supports enhancing the cooperation between the United Nations and regional and subregional organizations, in accordance with Chapter VIII of the Charter of the United Nations, so as to jointly safeguard international peace and security. ",claim
"The cooperation between the United Nations and regional and subregional organizations should, while steadfastly upholding the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, seek vigorously to promote dialogue and consultation aimed at addressing regional and hot-spot issues, actively engage in preventive diplomacy, resolve disputes through peaceful means and defuse conflicts. ",claim
"All relevant actions by the regional and subregional organizations concerned should observe the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter, in particular respect for the principles of the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of States. ",claim
The OSCE is an important partner of the United Nations. ,claim
China supports effective and pragmatic cooperation between the Security Council and the OSCE in the fields of peace and security ,claim
"it is our hope that the OSCE will continue to play an active and constructive role in upholding regional peace, security and stability. ",claim
"With respect to the question of Ukraine, the parties concerned, including the OSCE, have made some positive efforts, which China welcomes. ",claim
"We also hope that all parties concerned will fully implement resolution 2202 (2015) and the Minsk agreements and seek a comprehensive, lasting and balanced solution to the question of Ukraine through dialogue and consultation ",claim
"The international community should keep up its support for the diplomatic efforts of the parties concerned aimed at finding a political settlement of the question of Ukraine and at joining forces in contributing  to the achievement of peace, stability and development in the country at an early date. ",claim
We welcome the significant contribution that the OSCE continues to make in supporting the maintenance of international peace and security as one of the largest regional security organizations. ,claim
"Its comprehensive approach to security, which includes the political, military, economic, environmental and human dimensions, is in line with the new global paradigm aimed at ensuring sustainable peace and development. ",premise
we take note ofthe organization's efforts in conflict prevention and resolution as well as post-conflict reconstruction and peacebuilding. ,premise
"we appreciate the important role that the OSCE is playing in the efforts to resolve the protracted and new conflicts in South-Eastern Europe, Eastern Europe, the South Caucasus and Central Asia, in cooperation with the United Nations and the European Union ",claim
dialogue and negotiation remain the only way to find a durable and diplomatic solution to some of those conflicts and extremely delicate issues of peace and security affecting States members of the OSCE. ,premise
We cannot overemphasize the need for the political will and commitment ofthe parties to some of those conflicts to reach peaceful settlements but also to ensure that agreements are fully respected and implemented. ,claim
Building the necessary trust and confidence between and among the parties is also very critical to making tangible progress. ,claim
its commitment to continue exerting efforts to enhance informal and alternative channels of communication to improve mutual understanding and trust is very welcome. ,premise
the growing threats of terrorism and violent extremism pose a significant security challenge to States members of the OSCE. ,premise
The organization has been playing a very important role in preventing and combating terrorism by promoting a coordinated approach among member States. ,claim
it is only appropriate that the Austrian chairmanship is placing greater emphasize on addressing youth radicalization and violent extremism in the entire OSCE area. ,claim
Promoting cooperation with other relevant regional and international organizations will be Vital for the OSCE not only in countering terrorism but also in all the other dimensions of its work. ,premise
"Ethiopia attaches great importance to cooperation between the United Nations and regional organizations, in line with Chapter VIII of the Charter of the United Nations. ",claim
In the challenging strategic environment that Europe is facing today ,premise
"Austria knows that it can count on our full support to implement its programme of work, which is centred appropriately on the themes of security, conflict resolution and combating radicalization and terrorism. ",claim
"the OSCE serves as an indispensable toolbox for the security services in Europe, especially on the ground. ",claim
"The current crisis in eastern Ukraine is one of the most serious and dangerous violations of the founding principles of the OSCE, penned in Helsinki more than 40 years ago. ",premise
It is therefore appropriate that this topic has been a top priority on the organization's agenda for the past three years. ,premise
"The OSCE has been up to the task in responding to the matter, which is a source of satisfaction for us. ",claim
"It has lived up to the responsibility that falls upon it by rapidly deploying monitoring missions and subsequently assuming a central role in ensuring the implementation of the Minsk agreements, which remain the only way forward for a peaceful settlement of the conflict. ",premise
"France has been deeply concerned by the recent escalation of tensions on the ground, in particular around the town of Avdiivka, as well as its direct consequences in terms of the human toll and the worsening of the humanitarian situation. ",claim
"France is also determined, in conjunction with its German partners, to pursue mediation efforts within the Normandy format, as every bit of progress counts and we see no alternative solution for supporting the Minsk agreements. ",claim
The ministerial meeting held in Munich on Saturday made it possible to agree on specific commitments aimed at fostering a rapid improvement in the situation on the ground. ,premise
"Those commitments include the implementation of an immediate ceasefire, the withdrawal of heavy weapons, the protection of critical infrastructure, the effective disengagement of the most sensitive areas, the exchange of prisoners and access by the International Committee of the Red Cross to detention facilities. ",premise
It is essential that they be implemented as soon as possible ,claim
We remain convinced more than ever that the OSCE and its field missions have an essential role to play in ensuring the practical implementation of decisions taken at the political level. ,premise
it is crucial that the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine be in a position to fully and freely carry out its mandate. ,claim
We reiterate our call for the respect for the full freedom of movement of its observers ,claim
whose security must be guaranteed ,claim
"and condemn in the strongest terms any violation of these principles - whether it takes the form of intimidation, threats, destruction of equipment or denied access to certain areas. ",claim
"The involvement of the OSCE in securing local elections in the Donbas will also be necessary, in ways that remain to be determined. ",claim
I reiterate my country's commitment to defending the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. ,claim
France strongly condemns and does not recognize the illegal annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol. ,claim
"the OSCE remains more than ever an essential instrument for the promotion of peace and security in Europe, amid diverse threats. ",claim
First is the resolution of regional conflicts. ,claim
"we cannot accept the persistence of frozen conflicts in various parts of the European continent, whether in Nagorno Karabakh, Transnistria or the separatist territories of Georgia. ",premise
"We are convinced that the role of the OSCE is central to each, together with the established mediation formats, in order to promote dialogue and restore confidence. ",claim
"Achieving tangible progress on each of those fronts is in the interest of the concerned countries, but also of the region as a whole. ",premise
Next is the revival of conventional arms control in Europe. ,claim
There can be no strategic stability without a set of common rules to frame military competition. ,premise
"We are therefore in favour of continuing discussions on arms control, confidence-building, transparency and risk-reduction measures, initiated last year under the German chairmanship in the context of the OSCE'S structured dialogue. ",claim
Maintaining the centrality of the democracy and human rights pillar in the work of the OSCE is equally important. ,claim
"While a multidimensional approach has always been at the heart of the functioning of the OSCE, we are concerned about the tendency of some member States to increasingly politicize or even refuse to address human dimension issues. ",premise
"Specifically, the introduction of a selective approach to combating discrimination is unacceptable. ",claim
Last is the development of the operational role of the OSCE in response to certain emerging challenges. ,claim
"I am thinking of the fight against human trafficking, the prevention of radicalization, and climate change. ",premise
"The OSCE must work on each of those issues, which are priority security challenges for Europe, and respond with concrete measures that go beyond mere public posturing and statement of positions. ",claim
"I shall conclude my remarks by recalling the strong convergences between the action of the OSCE and that of the United Nations, whether on the ground - where their respective missions continue their integrated action, from the Balkans to the Caucasus and Central Asia- or on principles, with a common approach linking security, development and human rights concerns. ",claim
"As recognized at the OSCE, the ongoing aggression by the Russian Federation against Ukraine and its severe consequences remain among the top threats to European security. ",claim
It is important that defusing tensions and facilitating the resolution of the crisis in and around Ukraine be identified as priorities of the Austrian chairmanship. ,claim
"the Russian Federation effectively violated the United Nations Charter and all 10 principles of the Helsinki Final Act by resorting to armed aggression against the sovereign State of Ukraine, the illegal occupation of Crimea and hybrid warfare in Donbas. ",premise
The re-establishment of full respect for these principles is the way to restore the security order based on the OSCE process and the lessons of the Second World War. ,claim
"We therefore commend the determination of the Austrian chairmanship to protect the OSCE's fundamental principles and commitments, as it recently demonstrated by condemning Russia's unilateral measures on recognizing the so-called documents issued by illegal structures in certain areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine. ",claim
These actions on the part of Russia once again defied the OSCE principles and the Minsk agreements. ,premise
"We welcome the readiness of the chairmanship to exercise leadership in performing its functions, which is so urgently needed in these turbulent times for the OSCE community. ",claim
As the recent spike in hostilities near Avdiivka in Donbas has shown ,premise
the situation in the conflict-affected areas remains volatile and unpredictable. ,claim
Escalation is possible whenever the Russian Federation considers it politically necessary or just convenient. ,claim
"The military assault by the hybrid Russian forces on Avdiivka, accompanied by massive shelling along the entire line of contact ",premise
"Russia's persistent unwillingness to honour its Minsk commitments, including their first provision of a comprehensive and sustainable ceasefire. ",claim
"Russia's political goal of undermining Ukraine, which set in motion its aggression against my country three years ago, remains unchanged. ",claim
"Instead of a full and good-faith implementation of the Minsk commitments,  Russia is resorting to political and military provocations, blackmail and political pressure. ",claim
We commend the immediate response of the OSCE chairmanship and the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission in highlighting the scale of the offensive of the hybrid Russian forces and of its grave humanitarian impact. ,claim
"We appreciate the international diplomatic and political pressure brought to bear on the Russian Federation to stop the escalation, which has contributed to some improvement in the security situation in the conflict area ",claim
"A persistent focus, in particular at the OSCE and in the Security Council, on security and a peaceful resolution is needed to discourage Russia from future provocations and escalations and to force it to implement in full the commitments undertaken. ",claim
"The OSCE, the Trilateral Contact Group and its humanitarian subgroup should pay particular attention to achieving the immediate and unconditional release of Ukrainian citizens ",claim
"who remain illegally detained as hostages or political prisoners in the occupied areas of Donbas and in Crimea, as well as in the Russian Federation. ",premise
The international community must maintain a united position in order to secure their release. ,claim
"The resolution of the crisis in and around Ukraine, as the Russia-instigated conflict is called in the OSCE, requires not only a peaceful resolution of the situation in Donbas, with full respect for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, but also the de-occupation of the Crimean peninsula, which is an integral part of Ukraine. ",claim
"As the illegal occupation continues, so do the gross violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms by Russia's occupation authorities. ",claim
"In its resolution 71/205, entitled ""Situation ofhuman rights in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol (Ukraine)"", adopted on 19 December 2016, the General Assembly was absolutely clear about the extrajudicial killings, abductions, enforced disappearances, politically motivated prosecutions, discrimination, harassment, intimidation, violence, arbitrary detention, torture and ill-treatment against the residents of Crimea. ",premise
"The freedoms of expression, religion or belief and association and the right to peaceful assembly have been suppressed. ",claim
We must use all of the diplomatic assets and  international instruments at our disposal to make sure that Crimea does not become an exclusion zone with regard to basic human rights. ,claim
We encourage the OSCE chairmanship and institutions to pay close attention to the people in the occupied territory and to the alleviation of their plight. ,claim
"The implementation of the Minsk agreements and the OSCE's role in terms of monitoring, verification and mediation require adequate resources. ",premise
"We encourage Minister Kurz's support for the efforts of the Special Monitoring Mission in Ukraine to facilitate the resolution of the conflict in Donbas, which was started by Russia. ",claim
"Among the immediate tasks are ensuring the effectiveness of the monitoring and verification of the ceasefire and of the withdrawal of weapons, and the establishment of permanent monitoring at the uncontrolled segment of the Ukrainian-Russian State border, as set out in the Minsk agreements. ",claim
"The Mission's monitoring capabilities should be strengthened through increased use of high-technology equipment, including unmanned aerial vehicles, cameras and night-vision equipment. ",claim
Special Monitoring Mission monitors face restrictions on movement and intimidation by the hybrid Russian forces in Donbas in their everyday activities. ,premise
This is quite alarming. ,premise
"We encourage further discussions under the Austrian chairmanship on how to ensure security before, during and after the local elections in Donbas as a key element of the political settlement of the conflict, which will be possible only after all the necessary security prerequisites have been put in place. ",claim
"We welcome and support the Austrian chairmanship's priorities on strengthening instruments for conflict prevention and resolution, modernizing OSCE confidence- and security-building measures and launching a structured dialogue addressing the prevailing threats and the possible way forward. ",claim
My country is suffering as a result of terrorism and the terrorist groups regularly sent from the Russian Federation into Donbas through the uncontrolled segment of the State border with Ukraine. ,premise
"We are therefore interested in a sustained focus on the practical implementation of the counter-terrorism declaration adopted in Hamburg, as well as in strengthening border security, including by countering the phenomenon of foreign terrorist fighters and other non-State actors. ",claim
We see benefit in fostering international cooperation in these areas. ,claim
We support the intention of the Austrian chairmanship to dedicate special attention to cybersecurity and the further development of confidence- and security-building measures in the area. ,claim
The human dimension is at the core of the OSCE concept of comprehensive security. ,premise
"We support the Austrian chairmanship's determination to promote enhanced implementation of respective commitments, including in such areas as freedom of assembly and association, freedom of media and expression, freedom of religion or belief, tolerance and non-discrimination. ",claim
Strengthened cooperation with civil society should be an integral part of these efforts. ,claim
"We believe that such thematic issues as countering State propaganda, eradicating the phenomenon of political prisoners, combating torture and forced disappearances, and ensuring the rights of internally displaced persons and refugees should stay high on the OSCE agenda. ",claim
"There can be no security without respect to human dignity, the rule of law and fundamental human rights. ",claim
"The OSCE, as the largest regional security organization under Chapter VIII of the Charter of the United Nations, has an indispensable role to play in upholding the rules-based order in the European region to promote cooperation and security. ",claim
I would like to assure him of our full support. ,claim
"The Secretary-General has clearly outlined the importance of regional organizations in the maintenance of international peace and security, and his ambition to further enhance cooperation and coordination with those organizations. ",premise
"there is clear potential for greater United Nations- OSCE collaboration, particularly in the search for solutions to conflicts in Europe, which the Secretary- General has identified as a key priority. ",claim
"The OSCE's three dimensions of security are an operationalization of the broad concept of security, which the United Nations has also made its own, with sustaining peace at its heart. ",premise
"Through closer collaboration on issues of mutual concern, the United Nations and the OSCE can increase the strength and effectiveness of the work of both organizations. ",claim
The OSCE represents one of the most advanced levels of security cooperation in any region in the world. ,claim
"Its strength lies in a set of fundamental principles, to which we, as members, have all committed. ",premise
today there are challenges to what we have agreed. ,premise
it is essential that the OSCE focus on its core business. ,claim
"A frank and open dialogue among participating States, aimed at restoring respect for our commonly agreed principles and commitments - as enshrined, most notably, in the Helsinki Final Act and the Paris Charter - is needed. ",claim
It is essential that the comprehensive concept of security and the OSCE's role be upheld. ,claim
it is vital that the OSCE's human dimension and autonomous institutions are safeguarded. ,claim
Trust lies at the heart of conflict prevention and conflict resolution. ,claim
"Russia's ongoing aggression against Ukraine, its illegal annexation of Crimea and military actions in eastern Ukraine seriously challenge the rules-based European security order and erode that trust. ",claim
Rebuilding trust and confidence can happen through a renewed respect for the common principles and commitments to which we have all agreed. ,premise
We therefore welcome the Italian chairpersonship's emphasis on substantive dialogue on issues that are at the core of the OSCE mandate. ,claim
"We strongly support the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine, which must be given full, safe and unhindered access throughout Ukraine. ",claim
A possible United Nations peace mission in eastern Ukraine must have as its objective the restoration of Ukraine's sovereignty and its internationally recognized borders. ,claim
The Minsk process needs to be pursued and there must be delivery on its commitments. ,claim
"The protracted conflicts in Georgia, Moldova and Nagorno Karabakh are of great concern to the common OSCE acquis. ",premise
"Through the OSCE and the European Union, we continue to support peacebuilding measures and conflict resolution in Georgia, including through co-chairpersonship of the Geneva international discussions and the European Union Monitoring Mission on the ground. ",claim
it is of particular importance that the United Nations and the OSCE reinforce their cooperation and dialogue and coordinate activities to jointly pursue conflict prevention and peacebuilding. ,claim
"We see a good example of informal cooperation on the ground in Ukraine, where the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission and the United Nations human rights monitoring mission are both operating. ",claim
Women's participation in all aspects of peacebuilding and sustaining peace must be ensured. ,claim
We welcome the Italian chairpersonship's intention to mainstream a gender perspective into all ofits activities. ,claim
"Gender aspects, including the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000), must be an integral part of all our security-related work, both in Vienna and in the field missions. ",claim
"the Council, by working together with the OSCE, can more effectively promote human rights, the rule of law and democracy, and ensure peace and security in Europe. ",claim
That collaboration could be a model for United Nations cooperation with other regions that are in need of regional collaborative and security arrangements. ,claim
"Italy can count on our full support in addressing the priorities of its chairpersonship, which include conflicts in Europe, particularly Ukraine, challenges in the Mediterranean, transnational threats and, above all, respect for human rights - the keystone of peace and international security. ",claim
"the central role of the OSCE in our efforts to put an end to the Ukrainian crisis and the other priority challenges on which we, member States of the Security Council and the United Nations, must support the OSCE. ",claim
"The Ukrainian crisis is one of the gravest and most dangerous violations not only of the founding principles of the OSCE, established in Helsinki more than 40 years ago, but also of the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. ",claim
The OSCE has been able to respond appropriately to avoid the escalation of the conflict. ,claim
"It has acted responsibly by rapidly deploying a Special Monitoring Mission and by assuming thereafter a central role in supporting the implementation of the Minsk agreements, which remain the only possible path to a peaceful resolution to the conflict. ",premise
"France is determined, in collaboration with Germany, to pursue its mediation efforts using the Normandy format. ",claim
Each result obtained in this format and implemented on the ground counts. ,claim
We saw evidence of that in December with the exchange of prisoners between the Ukrainian State and the separatists. ,premise
Only progress in this format will support the implementation of the Minsk agreements by the parties. ,premise
We count on the Council to fully support their efforts to that end as soon as possible. ,claim
"We remain more convinced than ever that the OSCE, through its Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine, has a vital role to play in ensuring the implementation of political decisions on the ground. ",claim
the Special Monitoring Mission must be able to fully exercise its mandate without hindrance. ,premise
"We once again call for its staff to be granted freedom of movement and condemn in the strongest terms any violation of that principle, whether in the form of intimidation, threats or denial of access to certain areas. ",claim
"The OSCE's participation in the holding of future local elections in Donbas will also be necessary, although the modalities have yet to be determined. ",claim
our general goal remains the restoration of Ukraine's control over all its territory within the internationally recognized borders. ,premise
France strongly condemns and does not recognize the illegal annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol. ,claim
we encourage the OSCE's 57 members to abandon their political postures and to embrace instead the spirit of Helsinki ,premise
The first is the resolution of regional conflicts. ,claim
"Moving past the Ukrainian case, we cannot be satisfied with the persistence of stagnant conflicts on the European continent, be it in Nagorno Karabakh, Transnistria or the separatist territories of Georgia. ",premise
"We are convinced that the role of the OSCE is central in all such cases, both in connection with and within the framework of the established mediation formats, in order to promote dialogue and restore confidence which, as Minister Alfano and Deputy Minister Seder have stressed, are the key to resolving the conflicts. ",claim
we must preserve the instruments oftrust and military transparency on the European continent. ,claim
The arms control treaties and confidence-building measures developed in the OSCE's political-military dimension are unique and constitute pillars of the European security architecture. ,premise
"It is essential to preserve their implementation and relevance, including by adapting them to modern realities. ",claim
We are in favour of continuing discussions within the framework of the OSCE Structured Dialogue. ,claim
"the preservation of the human dimension must remain central to the work of the OSCE, in line with the wishes of the Italian chairpersonship. ",claim
This human dimension is central to the functioning and the identity of the OSCE. ,premise
It is also key to finding long- term solutions to crises. ,premise
To reject or marginalize that dimension can only undermine the prospects for peace and security in Europe. ,claim
we seek to promote the universality and indivisibility of all fundamental rights. ,claim
the OSCE must develop its operational role in response to certain emerging regional challenges. ,claim
"That applies, in particular, to combating human trafficking, preventing radicalization and addressing the impact of climate change on security. ",premise
Doing so is important for each of these key challenges to security in Europe. ,premise
The OSCE must develop concrete responses that are not merely public statements of position. ,claim
I will conclude by recalling the strong convergences that exist between the actions of the OSCE and those of the United Nations. ,premise
"Those two organizations share a common approach that combines security, development and human rights. ",premise
"It is our duty, in the Council, to continue to support the efforts of the OSCE in all crises in which it is called upon to act. ",claim
"The United States greatly appreciates the OSCE's efforts in promoting security, stability and good governance in the region and throughout the world. ",claim
"The United States greatly appreciates the contributions it has made over more than 40 years in helping to underpin stability, security and prosperity throughout the region. ",claim
As an OSCE participating State ,premise
the United States supports its partners and reaffirms its own commitment to that crucial effort. ,claim
In order to strengthen the OSCE's utility and preserve its function as a primary forum for an open dialogue on core European security concerns ,premise
we strongly support the continuation of its structured dialogue on current and future challenges and risks. ,claim
"That initiative has opened up productive and frank deliberations among participating States, fostering mutual understanding and cooperation in addressing the leading challenges of our day. ",premise
"One of the greatest security and humanitarian challenges the OSCE is facing today is the continuing crisis in eastern Ukraine, where Russian acts of aggression have claimed more than 10,000 lives. ",claim
"Russia and the forces it arms, trains, leads and fights alongside have perpetuated the conflict for too long. ",premise
The United States commends the OSCE's efforts to resolve the conflict in eastern Ukraine. ,claim
"We recognize in particular the essential role of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine, which remains the international community's best source of impartial information on the significant toll that the conflict in eastern Ukraine has taken on the country's people, land and infrastructure. ",premise
"The fact that Russia, a member of the OSCE, continues to drive the conflict is a terrible irony. ",claim
The OSCE's role in facilitating humanitarian work has been critical to alleviating the suffering caused by four years of aggression. ,claim
We applaud the courage and dedication of the Monitoring Mission's unarmed monitors and strongly support efforts to ensure their safety in carrying out their critical mission. ,claim
The United States continues to support the Minsk agreements and their full implementation as the best path to restoring Ukraine's territorial integrity and alleviating the suffering in the Donbas region. ,claim
"While both sides must implement their Minsk commitments, Russia can single-handedly bring peace and end the conflict by withdrawing its forces. ",claim
We also call for an end to Russia's occupation of Crimea ,claim
"which has contributed to needless violence, displacement and death for too long. ",premise
"Beyond Ukraine, the United States welcomes and supports the OSCE's continuing efforts to resolve the conflicts in Nagorno Karabakh, Georgia and Transnistria. ",claim
"It must remain focused on those protracted conflicts in order to underscore the fact that frozen and status-quo conflicts are completely antithetical to the peace, stability and security priorities of the OSCE and the international community. ",claim
"The OSCE's crucial role in strengthening security and stability, addressing the humanitarian needs of conflict-afflicted populations and promoting good governance in its region cannot be overstated. ",claim
The United States fully supports the OSCE's comprehensive approach to addressing critical security challenges. ,claim
We also unequivocally affirm its importance as a partner to the United Nations and in particular to the Security Council in protecting and promoting peace and prosperity. ,claim
"The United Kingdom fully supports the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and its efforts to achieve stability, peace and democracy for the people of Europe, including through dialogue. ",claim
"the OSCE is a pillar of the international rules- based system, and respect for its fundamental principles  must be restored. ",claim
Nowhere in Europe is that more important than in Ukraine. ,claim
"I would like reaffirm the United Kingdom's full support for Ukraine's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, including in Crimea. ",claim
"In addition to annexing Crimea, Russia has destabilized eastern Ukraine and continues to fuel the conflict, at enormous human and material cost to the Ukrainian people. ",claim
"As always, it is the civilians who suffer most. ",claim
"Since the conflict began, more than 10,300 people have lost their lives, almost 25,000 have been injured and 3.4 million are in need of humanitarian assistance, particularly along the line of contact. ",premise
"We have seen reports that more than 1,000 Russian military personnel and mercenaries have lost their lives, so the Russian people are also mourning their children. ",premise
"Only by means of a truly sustainable ceasefire and genuine political will, through the implementation of the Minsk agreements ",premise
can the conflict be brought to an end. ,claim
We welcome the most recent recommitment to the ceasefire by the Trilateral Contact Group. ,claim
"However, past ceasefires have been broken and have not resulted in sustained improvements to the security situation. ",premise
"While the conflict continues, the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine, ably directed by Chief Monitor Apakan, must be permitted to carry out its mandate in full and granted complete, safe and unhindered access to all Ukraine, including Crimea and the parts of the border with Russia that are not under Ukraine's control. ",claim
"The increasingly aggressive behaviour and threats that we seeing directed at the OSCE monitors are deeply worrying, and we have not forgotten the sacrifice of paramedic Joseph Stone on 23 April last year. ",premise
"If, as Russia claims, it truly cares about the people of the Donbas region, it should end the fighting that it started, withdraw its military personnel and weapons and cease its support for the separatists. ",claim
Russia should also show a genuine political will to end the conflict and abide by the Minsk agreements that it signed ,claim
We must retain the Council's focus on Ukraine. ,claim
"The chaos, violence and ongoing loss of life resulting from Russia's military operations clearly merit the Council's time. ",premise
We must be ready to remain seized of the issue. ,claim
"We welcome and support Italy's intention to prioritize tackling modern slavery and addressing the challenges associated with migration, including corruption and trafficking. ",claim
"we support Italy's focus on the implementation of the OSCE Action Plan for the Promotion of Gender Equality and on protracted conflicts, which continue to undermine security in the OSCE region. ",claim
Those are areas where the OSCE's cross-dimensional approach can add real value. ,premise
We have always proceeded from the assumption that the work of the OSCE is particularly important to the European continent ,claim
we have always supported strengthening European institutions and agreements on treaty and legal regimes in our shared security area. ,claim
Russia is firmly committed to the Helsinki principles for relations between States and to political obligations undertaken in that regard. ,claim
our calls for reasonable dialogue and practical implementation of the principles of equal and indivisible security in the West have so far gone unheeded. ,claim
"Some of our partners continue to prefer to see things in terms of the Cold War, portraying Russia as a threat to peace and security and forming closed clubs in which some countries' security can come only at others' expense. ",premise
"The result of all that has been that today the Euro-Atlantic architecture, of which the Charter of the United Nations and the Helsinki Final Act remain the cornerstones, is being severely tested. ",premise
"it is more important than ever to strengthen multilateral cooperation, including through international organizations. ",claim
"That cooperation should be regular and multifaceted, and should cover every aspect of security. ",claim
It is the OSCE's job to help to realize the purposes and principles of the United Nations in the context of its mandate and the area within its purview. ,claim
"we share its desire to strengthen multilateralism for peace, security, stability and cooperation among the States of the region. ",claim
We have great expectations for the increased cooperation between the OSCE and the United Nations ,claim
especially considering what has already been achieved so far. ,premise
"We have especially noted the intensive collaboration between the OSCE secretariat's Transnational Threats Department and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime in combating the illegal trade in drugs and small arms, terrorism, organized crime, corruption and money- laundering, as well as in countering human trafficking and illegal migration. ",premise
"An important area of cooperation between the two organizations is the implementation of the Security Council's anti-terrorism resolutions, as well as in fighting the ideology of terrorism, as is provided for in resolution 2354 (2017). ",claim
"In the area of international security information, the OSCE complements the global United Nations efforts to develop confidence-building measures through the use of information and communications technologies. ",claim
We urge it to join efforts to develop and implement additional concrete confidence-building measures in the interests of providing cybersecurity. ,claim
Those platforms should not be used for unfounded accusations in that regard. ,claim
We value cooperation between the United Nations and the OSCE on the ground ,claim
"as has occurred through its Mission in Kosovo, as well as their collaboration in the Geneva talks on Transcaucasia aimed at establishing a direct dialogue between Georgia, Abkhazia and South Ossetia. ",premise
"In order to understand the reason for the deteriorating situation in Ukraine, we have to go back practically to the very beginning and recall how the problems in Ukraine first started. ",claim
"Our assessments of the origin and current situation of what I emphasize is an internal Ukrainian crisis do not coincide, to put it mildly. ",claim
"Four years ago, with the direct involvement of the West, there was a coup d'etat in Ukraine. ",premise
"Those who came to power decided to rid Ukraine of everything Russian and the Russian language that was native to millions of the country's citizens, and to tie them to a paradigm of development to which they never consented and could not accept. ",premise
There was absolutely no desire for reconciliation with the new authorities in Crimea or eastern Ukraine. ,premise
Crimeans freely chose unification with Russia. ,premise
In Donbas they were attacked with bullets and shells. ,premise
"For the whole of those four years, Kyiv has not only been at war with its own citizens, it has persistently cultivated hatred for Russia in society and has permitted an orgy of nationalism and xenophobia, with the full connivance of our Western partners. ",premise
"Without Kyiv's acknowledgement of the depravity of those policies, it is unlikely that anything will change for the better. ",premise
"The key to resolving the problems in Ukraine lies in the hands of the Ukrainians themselves, and only the Ukrainians. ",claim
"But Kyiv chose a convenient formula, dumping the blame for all of its problems and its unwillingness to engage in a dialogue with its own citizens on the infamous Russian aggression, which no one has been able to present evidence of. ",premise
And of course the Western curators are hardly burning with a desire to put Kyiv on a constructive path. ,claim
Resolution 2202 (2015) enshrined the Minsk agreements as the basis for settling the situation in Ukraine. ,premise
"However, right from the beginning, Kyiv worked to sabotage the process and rewrite the agreements' intentions, while the recently passed law on the so-called reintegration of Donbas has officially buried the Minsk package of measures. ",claim
"We can cite numerous other examples of the provocative actions of the Ukrainian authorities, such as their discriminatory language policy, the indulging of neo-Nazist movements, the countless violation of laws by its own citizens and the fomenting of hatred against Russia. ",premise
They turn a blind eye to the scandalous vandalism of Russian cultural centres ,premise
seizing Russian businesses has virtually become official policy ,premise
and they have created an atmosphere of totalitarian suppression of all opposition voices. ,premise
"Opposition journalists are being murdered, and I could continue this list. ",premise
But the West prefers not to notice. ,claim
The Kyiv authorities have been indulged by their sponsors and given carte blanche to say and do whatever they feel like. ,claim
"As long as that continues and Kyiv continues to undermine the Minsk agreements, as long as it refuses to talk directly to its own citizens while falsely presenting Russia as a party to the conflict but not themselves ",premise
we can expect nothing good and no genuine settlement. ,claim
"For our part, we are directly interested in normalizing the situation in Ukraine as soon as possible ",claim
we are doing everything we can to facilitate that. ,claim
"We support the efforts of the OSCE in the Trilateral Contact Group and the work of the Special Monitoring Mission in Donbas, which is acting as the international observer for the implementation by the parties - Kyiv, Donetsk and Luhansk - of the Minsk agreements ",claim
I would like to once again emphasize that Russia sees the OSCE as an important mechanism for building an equal and indivisible system of pan- European security and wants to strengthen its role and prestige. ,claim
"in order to increase the OSCE's prestige, it is essential to define its priorities. ",claim
The necessity for reform is long overdue. ,claim
"At issue are its adoption of a charter and rules for its executive structures' operations, as well as introducing order and transparency in many other areas. ",claim
"strengthening the OSCE and ensuring that it attains the current goal, as outlined in Astana in 2010, of establishing a free, democratic and indivisible security association from Vancouver to Vladivostok, is in the interests of all States Members of the United Nations. ",claim
We urge it to concern itself not with imaginary threats but with real ones. ,claim
"we should think together about a renewed long-term international security system that would be built on the principles of respect for the interests of other countries, international law and the key role of the United Nations. ",claim
"All over the world, a wide spectrum of challenges with increasingly complex risks are quickly emerging. ",premise
"No country can respond to them alone, and no country can remain immune. ",premise
Global issues require global solutions. ,claim
Collective security requires collective maintenance. ,claim
"While the United Nations is at the core of the international collective-security architecture, regional and subregional organizations also enjoy unique advantages in resolving regional hot-spot issues. ",premise
"China supports enhancing the cooperation between the United Nations and regional and subregional organizations, in accordance with Chapter VIII of the Charter of the United Nations, with the aim of jointly maintaining international peace and security. ",claim
The cooperation between the United Nations and regional and subregional organizations should firmly uphold the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations while working diligently to address hot-spot issues through dialogue and consultation and engaging actively in preventive diplomacy with the aim of defusing and resolving disputes peacefully. ,premise
The OSCE is an important partner of the United Nations. ,claim
"In recent years it has been actively engaged in preventive diplomacy, promoting security and mutual trust among countries in the region and mediating regional disputes, efforts that China appreciates and applauds. ",premise
"We welcome Italy's decision to designate dialogue, ownership and responsibility as its working motto during its chairship-in-office, and to respond actively to terrorism, illicit smuggling, transnational crimes and refugee crises, among other challenges. ",claim
"China supports practical and effective cooperation between the Security Council and the OSCE in the areas of peace and security, and we are eager to see the OSCE continue to play an active and constructive role in upholding regional peace, security and stability. ",claim
"We welcome all the positive efforts being made by all the parties concerned, including the OSCE, to find a peaceful solution to the Ukrainian issue. ",claim
"We hope that all the parties concerned will work to fully implement the relevant Security Council resolutions and the Minsk agreements, with the aim of reaching a comprehensive, lasting and balanced solution to the question of Ukraine through dialogue and consultation. ",claim
"The international community should continue to support the diplomatic efforts of all the parties concerned to arrive at a political settlement of the Ukrainian issue so as to collectively restore peace, stability and development in Ukraine as soon as possible. ",claim
