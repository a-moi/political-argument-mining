forward, as we all know, is de-escalation, dialogue and the free elections that are planned for 25 May.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'And Ukraine must be allowed to prepare for those elections without the interference and coercion we are witnessing.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'But talks can take place only with genuine commitment and good faith on all sides.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'The talks between Russia, Ukraine,

elections in May, we believe that political differences must be addressed in a non-violent way through a legitimate process.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'United Nations States Members should respect that process, and there should not be any influence exerted by outside forces.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'We reiterate our strong support for the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of Ukraine.'],

the Government of Ukraine have been severely challenged by recent developments in the eastern regions.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'According to Ukrainian intelligence data, during the past month and a half in

their country.'], ['O', 'Arg', 'Why were they not called terrorists?'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'Indeed, they have been exempted from any responsibility for the criminal activities they conducted for several months.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'I reiterate that, unfortunately, several clumsy accusations have been made against Russia.'], ['Arg', 'O', 'It has been said that Russia somehow wishes to destabilize Ukraine, if not practically crush it altogether.'], ['O', 'Arg', 'But why was there no response to our call at the start of the crisis for launching a dialogue on how to help Ukraine emerge from the political and economic crisis it had found itself in?'], ['O', 'Arg', 'Why was the crisis encouraged to continue?'], ['O', 'O', 'Why was it only just a few days ago that the Foreign Ministers of France, Germany and Poland said that the European Union and Russia should indeed talk about the economic prospects for Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova in connection with their joining the partnership programme of the European Union.'], ['O', 'O', 'And, by the way, we have heard nothing about the fact that those ministerial conversations took place in Brussels.'], ['O', 'O', 'Let us see what the response will be to the reproaches to Russia over the fact that we do not want supply Ukraine with gas for free.'], ['Arg', 'O', 'Let us see on 14 April what response the European ministers will give to the letter that President Putin wrote proposing that we work together to help Ukraine emerge from its economic turmoil.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'It is true that the people in Washington, DC, to whom we did not send the letter, have already poisoned it for the European Union, calling it economic blackmail.'], ['Arg', 'O', 'But let us see whether the European Union has retained some kind of sovereignty and whether it is capable of making independent, rational decisions that can help to rescue the situation from crisis.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'During the entire course of the crisis in Ukraine, Russia has never advocated aggravating it or destabilizing the country.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'We have absolutely no interest in doing such a thing, since for us Ukraine is too important as an economic

results that we are now witnessing.'], ['Arg', 'O', 'Mr. Fernandez-Taranco said that it was on 6 April that the actions were first observed whereby residents of south-eastern areas of Ukraine were seizing certain administrative buildings.'], ['Arg', 'O', 'And in this, of course, they learned from the experience of the Maidan in Kyiv, where for weeks and months administrative buildings were occupied, and which for some reason our Western partners saw as demonstrations of democracy.'], ['Arg', 'O', 'But when it came to the south-eastern regions of Ukraine, somehow such tactics were unacceptable.'], ['Arg', 'O', 'A month and a half elapsed between 21 February and 6 April; a month and a half had gone by since the overthrow of President Yanukovych and the conclusion of the agreement that could have prevented an escalation of the situation.'], ['Arg', 'O', 'From the very beginning, all we said was that it was essential to conclude that agreement; that perhaps a constitutional assembly should be convoked; and that some decisive gesture should be made towards the south-eastern regions of Ukraine.'], ['O', 'O', 'Was any such gesture made?'], ['O', 'O', 'Finally, Mr. Yatsenyuk came, said something and left.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'Then Mr. Turchynov came the next day and did not seem to agree with him.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'It seemed they preferred to use force.'], ['O', 'O', 'Incidentally, some very worrying tones have crept into our numerous contacts with our Western colleagues.'], ['O', 'O', 'As the Council knows, our Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Sergei Lavrov, has been talking to Secretary of State Kerry on the phone almost every day.'], ['Arg', 'O', 'Kerry continually claims to understand our concern that in contacts with the Ukrainian authorities genuine efforts should be made to ensure that they demonstrate a better grasp of the concerns of the south-eastern regions of Ukraine regarding a definition of their autonomy, independence and language rights.'], ['Arg', 'O', 'And then suddenly one ofthe United States Deputy Secretaries of State gets up in Congress and says, we know that these talks will not lead anywhere, but we have to occupy the time somehow.'], ['O', 'O', '"Occupy the time."'], ['Arg', 'Arg', "So, really, maybe somebody in Washington, DC, is thinking about Turchynov's military offensive scenario."], ['Arg',

Ukraine, it seems, on 21 April.'], ['Arg', 'O', 'But maybe he should not wait for 21 April.'], ['Arg', 'O', 'Maybe he should go right now.'], ['Arg', 'O', 'Pick up the phone, call Mr. Turchynov - as he called President Yanukovych more than once before 21 February - and say to him what he said to Mr. Yanukovych.'], ['Arg', 'O', 'As we were informed by the Vice-President\'s Chief of Staff, he said, "For God\'s sake, just do not use force.'], ['Arg', 'O', 'Call off your forces from the centre of Kyiv".'], ['O', 'O', 'That was what Mr. Biden said.'], ['O', 'Arg', 'And now, is the United States going to encourage the fulfilment of this criminal decree authorizing the use of military force?'], ['Arg', 'Arg', "Why, in one case, when it was a question of preparations to storm the residence of the President of Ukraine, the call was that under no circumstances should force be used, while in the current situation, it is to encourage the insane military actions that Turchynov's decree talks about?"], ['Arg', 'Arg', "I would therefore request Ms. Power to ask Vice-President Biden to call Mr. Turchynov right now, because in a few hours' time things might take an irreversible turn."], ['O', 'O', 'Many colleagues mentioned the meeting that was announced for 17 April.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'Indeed, for some months now, in particular during the period after 21 February, we have constantly encouraged such formats for dialogue as a possible way to achieve a solution to the crisis.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'We agreed in principle that the meeting would take place among the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, Secretary of State Kerry, Ms. Ashton and the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'We very much hope that such a high-level meeting will encourage a broad political dialogue in Ukraine and show the way towards a political solution to the crisis.'], ['O', 'O', 'But what does the Council think?'], ['O', 'O', 'If armed force is used and hostilities take place tomorrow, are we really going to sign off on that meeting?'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'Of course, that initiative is going to be fundamentally undermined if military operations are commenced in south-eastern Ukraine.'], ['O', 'O', 'Please, let us refrain from any accusations or speculation as to why Russia is trying to do what it is doing.'], ['Arg', 'O', 'Let us focus our attention on what we can actually do in this case.'], ['O', 'O', 'Here I am speaking to my Western colleagues.'], ['Arg', 'O', 'Let us ensure that we do not permit the Ukrainian authorities to commit the reckless actions that are currently enshrined in the criminal decree by Mr. Turchynov, and let us stop that decree from being implemented.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'That would have extremely significant consequences, first and foremost for the people of Ukraine, of course.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'That needs to be avoided.'], ['O', 'O', 'I will be brief, but in response to my colleague from the Russian Federation, I would like to say just a few things.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'First, the United States has constantly called for de-escalation and urged restraint.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'That has been our consistent policy.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'Our consistent statements have made clear that military force is not the answer, and we have commended the Ukrainians, frankly, for enduring more than probably any country in the United Nations could or would endure without using force.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'Therefore, there have been no shortage of efforts at diplomacy.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'Secondly, it is not the United States that has escalated the situation, it is the Russian Federation.'], ['O', 'Arg', 'Thirdly, while we would like to place our faith in talks with the Russian Federation, the European Union and Ukraine, it is hard to reconcile the behaviour of the Russian Federation, the propaganda of the Russian Federation and the military actions of the Russian Federation - which range from the massing of 40,000 troops on the border to the subversive activities inside Ukraine - with their appeal for diplomacy and de-escalation.'], ['Arg', 'O', 'It is an appeal that we wish were in fact sincere.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'Fourthly, a few times, the representative of the Russian Federation has described what is happening in the eastern cities as protests and demonstrations.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', "I would refer back to my French colleague's comment that those claims are rooted in some idea that the Internet does not exist and that people cannot see for themselves that they are not protests and they are not demonstrations."], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'They are professional forces carrying weapons - Russian-made weapons, as it happens - and carrying out sophisticated, coordinated military operations across a substantial number of eastern Ukrainian cities.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'They are not demonstrations.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'They are not protests.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'They are military operations.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'Finally, the credibility of the Russian Federation has been gravely undermined.'], ['O', 'O', 'That said, we remain eager and willing to talk about how to de-escalate the situation.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'That will require that the Russian Federation pull back its forces, which are ominously stationed and massed at the eastern Ukrainian border.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'It will require that the Russian Federation work to de-escalate the situation in the light of the armed takeover of those buildings.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'If, in fact, the Russian Federation is interested in peace and in upholding its role as an enforcer of international peace and security, then it will engage quickly and with a wholly different degree of conviction, urgency and truthfulness than it has up to this point.'], ['O', 'O', 'Several issues were raised by our Russian colleague.'], ['O', 'O', 'I would like to answer just one.'], ['Arg', 'O', '(spoke in Russian) First, Mr. Churkin compared the situation in December and January with the current situation.'], ['O', 'Arg', 'We must recall that, at that time, the people were speaking out against the banditry of the authorities, and now it is bandits who are against the people.'], ['O', 'Arg', 'There is a difference there.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'We cannot remain calm about the fact that several hundred separatists are holding thousands of people hostage to fear in towns.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'We see the standoffs on television in Kharkiv, Luhansk and Dnipropetrovsk.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'We cannot look on while small groups of armed people, headed up, inter alia, by agents from the Russian Federation, seize State buildings and take weapons to hand out.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'Indeed, those are terrorist operations that have been specially organized and orchestrated.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'Mr. Churkin is absolutely right, there is not much time left at all, there is just about an hour and a half.'], ['Arg', 'O', 'It is just as easy for him to call his President and say a few simple things to him as it is for me to do so, so I will repeat them here.'], ['Arg', 'O', 'The statement that Mr. Churkin has referred very negatively to several times today was made by the acting President, Mr. Turchynov, and was addressed to those people who are now creating tension in those towns, the terrorist groups of separatists.'], ['Arg', 'O', 'He stated: (spoke in English) "Those not involved in shooting at Ukrainian law enforcement officers and who will surrender their weapons and leave State administrative buildings will be released from prosecution."'], ['Arg', 'Arg', '(spoke in Russian) Why do they not call their people and tell them to come back, sit down around the negotiating table and decide together how we can establish good neighbourly relations?'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'That would be the right thing to do.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'The Government mentioned the referendum, changes to the Constitution, the retention of the language law and the fact that the problems that have cropped up over the decades and remained unsolved by previous Governments needed to be addressed at last.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'That is something that we need to do, but we are being prevented from doing so.'], ['O', 'O', 'I would like Mr. Churkin to listen to that and convey what he can to his Government.'], ['O', 'O', '(spoke in English) I am sincerely thankful to the members of the Security Council who spoke in favour of a peaceful resolution of the problems in Ukraine.'], ['Arg', 'O', 'I am sincerely thankful for that.'], ['O', 'O', 'I also thank the members of the Security Council for understanding the critical situation in Ukraine and for any kind of support they can provide.'], ['Arg', 'O', "I shall not take up much ofthe Council's time."], ['O', 'O', 'I should just like to say two things.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'First, the representative of Ukraine is far too easy in characterizing his own people as bandits.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'The Right Sector and those who say the demonstrators should be killed are not bandits; they are simply the political elite of Kyiv.'], ['O', 'O', "Are not those who are protesting in eastern Ukraine able to do so without Russia's say-so?"], ['O', 'O', 'Do they need Russia to say that events in Kyiv are unacceptable before they are able to grasp that?'], ['O', 'O', 'When radicals come to tell the miners of that region that they will establish their own order - surely the miners can understand that without a hint from Russia?'], ['O', 'O', 'Are the protesters able to understand how bad things have become only when Russian agents come to explain the situation to them?'], ['O', 'O', 'Do their own life experience and understanding of the situation in their own country count for nothing?'], ['O', 'O', 'How will those things influence them?'], ['Arg', 'O', 'Secondly, with regard to the statement made by my American colleague Ms. Power, she did not mention her view on the decree to use armed force in eastern Ukraine.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', "I hope that, as the Ukrainian representative has called for, following today's discussion some Western colleagues and partners will pick up the telephone and call their leaders and those in Kyiv with whom they enjoy influence, who may not act unless they get the green light from Western capitals."], ['Arg', 'O', 'I would ask my colleagues to give them the red light and tell them that problems can be resolved through dialogue and not military confrontation.'], ['O', 'O', 'I am grateful to Under-Secretary-General Feltman for his briefing.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'The United Kingdom requested this meeting because we are deeply concerned by the deteriorating security situation in southern and eastern Ukraine and by the fact that the Geneva agreement of 17 April is not yet achieving its objective to restore stability in Ukraine.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'It is vitally important that the Security Council maintain its close scrutiny of events in Ukraine and the consequent threat to international peace and security.'], ['Arg', 'O', 'We will doubtless hear Russian claims that it is the actions of the Ukrainian Government that are destabilizing the south and east of the country.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'In fact, it is Russia that has taken further dangerous steps aimed at fomenting instability in Ukraine.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'It has directed paramilitary actions in Sloviansk, Kramatorsk, Lugansk and other towns in eastern Ukraine.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'Russian military jets and helicopters have made incursions into Ukrainian airspace.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', "Russian armed forces have held further military exercises on Ukraine's border."], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'These are all clear attempts to escalate tensions within Ukraine.'], ['Arg', 'O', 'These steps have been matched with intensified rhetoric.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'The Permanent Representative of the Russian Federation has asserted that Russia has a legal basis to intervene in Ukraine in accordance with the right of self-defence under Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', "This is a claim that takes Russia's distortion of international law to a new level."], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'There is no justification or legal basis whatsoever for invoking Article 51.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'Russian nationals are not under threat in Ukraine - a fact that has been reaffirmed on numerous occasions, including by the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission and by the Commissioner for National Minorities of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'This is deeply irresponsible rhetoric intended to threaten and intimidate the Ukrainian Government and provide a bogus pretext for further illegal breaches of Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', "As a result of Russia's activities, there has been a further marked deterioration in the security situation in eastern and southern Ukraine, as Mr. Feltman

difficult situation in Ukraine.'], ['O', 'O', 'I am wondering, and I would also like to ask the Council, why we are having this meeting.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'Going over the difficult situation and the

diplomacy that was initiated on 17 April with a view to finding a peaceful and political solution to this critical situation, Russia, the United States, the European Union and Ukraine all expressed at Geneva a willingness to reach an agreement.'], ['Arg', 'O', 'What we saw as willingness to agree, the whole world saw as a source of hope.'], ['O', 'Arg', 'Today, however, we must urge the parties to return to a constructive dialogue.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'The difficult situation facing Ukraine cannot be resolved through unilateral actions of any sort.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'It is essential that we

'The other reason we are here is to reject violence involving two concrete events, namely, the attack against the Mayor of Kharkiv, in eastern Ukraine, and, as requested by the Secretary-General, Argentina calls for the immediate and unconditional release of the military observers of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe who are being held hostage.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'Again we reiterate that the Council meets in order to promote peace.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'With a pen in hand and with our good faith, we stand ready to help Ukraine emerge from this difficult situation so that it can achieve the peace that its people deserve.'], ['O', 'O', 'I thank Under-Secretary-General Feltman for his briefing.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'On 17 April, Ukraine, the Russian Federation, the European Union and the United States issued the Geneva joint statement to de-escalate the crisis that brings us together this evening.'], ['Arg', 'O', 'That statement outlined a series of concrete steps to end the violence, halt provocative actions and protect the rights and security of all Ukrainian citizens.'], ['Arg', 'O', 'As Secretary Kerry said on 17 April, "All of this, we are convinced, represents a good day\'s work.'], ['Arg', 'O', "The day's work has produced principles and it has produced commitments and it has produced words on paper."], ['Arg', 'O', 'And we are the first to understand and to agree that words on paper will only mean what the actions that are taken as a result of those words produce."'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'Secretary Kerry also commended Foreign Minister Lavrov and the Ukrainian Foreign Minister for their cooperation in achieving that hard-negotiated agreement.'], ['O', 'Arg', 'It was a moment of hope.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'Since then, the Government of Ukraine has been implementing its commitments in good faith.'], ['O', 'Arg', 'Regrettably, the same cannot be said of the Russian Federation.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'As we meet, observers from the special monitoring mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) are reporting that most of Ukraine, including eastern Ukraine, is peaceful.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'The exceptions are in such areas as Donetsk, Luhansk and Sloviansk, where pro-Russian separatists continue to occupy buildings and attack local officials.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'There we have seen a sharp deterioration in law and order.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'Just today, pro-Russian separatists armed with baseball bats, stormed the Government buildings in Luhansk, seizing control of the centre of municipal activity in one of the largest cities in eastern Ukraine.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'That kind of thuggery mimics the seizures of police stations, city halls and other Government buildings in cities and towns in Donetsk oblast and surrounding areas.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'In addition to occupying Government buildings, over the past two weeks, gunmen kidnapped a senior police officer in Luhansk.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'In Donetsk,

17 buildings, including the regional television broadcasting centre.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'In the city of Sloviansk, the mayor was kidnapped, as were several journalists.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'The separatists in that area now hold an estimated 40 hostages.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'Nearby, three bodies were recently pulled from a river, each showing unmistakable signs of physical abuse; one has been identified as a local politician, another as a 19 year-old pro-unity student activist.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'Yesterday, gunmen reportedly chased members of the Sloviansk Roma community from their homes.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'Make no mistake: those are not peaceful protests.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'It is not an eastern Ukrainian spring.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'It is a well-orchestrated campaign, with external support, to destabilize the Ukrainian State.'], ['O', 'Arg', 'Finally, as all the world knows, pro-Russian separatists in Donetsk have kidnapped and continue to hold seven international inspectors, openly declared as members of a Vienna document mission, along with their Ukrainian escorts.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'My Government joins with responsible Governments everywhere in condemning that unlawful act and in being outraged by the shameful exhibition before the media of those international public servants.'], ['Arg', 'O', 'The Vienna document, agreed upon by all 57 participating States of the OSCE, has been a lasting source of cooperation and military transparency.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'We call, with others, for the immediate and unconditional release of the inspectors and their Ukrainian escorts and the immediate end to their mistreatment while in captivity.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'We also call upon Russia, as a signatory to the Vienna document, to help secure their release and to confirm publicly, even if belatedly, for the record that the abducted monitors were part of a legitimate mission on behalf of the international community.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'Since 17 April, the Government of Ukraine has acted in good faith and with admirable restraint to fulfil its commitments.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'The Kyiv city hall and its surrounding area are now clear of all Maidan barricades and protestors.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'Over the Easter holiday, Ukraine voluntarily suspended its counter-terrorism initiative, choosing to de-escalate despite its fundamental right to provide security on its own territory and for its own people.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'Unlike the separatists, Ukraine has cooperated fully with the OSCE special monitoring mission and allowed its observers to operate in regions about which Moscow had voiced concerns regarding the treatment of ethnic Russians.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'In addition, Prime Minister Yatsenyuk has publicly committed his Government to undertake far-reaching constitutional reforms that will strengthen the power of the regions.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'He has appealed personally to Russian-speaking Ukrainians, pledging to support special status for the Russian language and to protect those who use it.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'He announced legislation to grant amnesty to those who surrender arms.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'All of that should be cause for optimism and hope.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'Tragically, what we have seen from Russia since 17 April is exactly what we saw from Russia prior to 17 April: more attempts to stir up trouble, more efforts to undermine the Government of Ukraine and statement after statement at odds with the facts.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'What we have not seen is a single positive step by Russia to fulfil its Geneva commitments.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'Instead, Russian officials have refused to publicly call on the separatists to give up their weapons and relinquish their illegal control of Ukrainian Government buildings.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'In fact, Russia continues to fund, to coordinate and to fuel the heavily armed separatist movement.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', "In addition, just outside of Ukraine's border, Russia has continued to engage in threatening troop movements that are designed not to calm tensions, but to embolden the separatists and to intimidate the Government."], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'In conclusion, I emphasize that the United States remains committed to supporting the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and will continue to uphold the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'We continue to seek stability within a peaceful, democratic, inclusive and united Ukraine, especially in advance of the upcoming important elections.'], ['Arg', 'Arg',

['Arg', 'Arg', 'But, having taken that first step, the people who made those attempts have nonetheless been unable to stop and have gone on with them.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'This time that has led to serious destabilization in Ukraine.'], ['Arg', 'O', 'I would like to remind the Council that, during the several months of crises preceding the overthrow of the lawful administration between 21 and 25 February, our Western colleagues never once called for a halt to the violence perpetrated in Kyiv and other regions of Ukraine against the lawful authorities.'], ['Arg', 'O', 'There were no calls to President Yanukovych to use every possible means at his disposal as lawful President, including that of force, in order to impose order in the country.'], ['O', 'O', 'But now, for some reason, those calls are coming loud and clear.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'During this entire crisis, Russia has wanted only one thing, which is to avoid destabilization in Ukraine and settle everything through negotiations.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'We proposed tripartite talks among Ukraine, the European Union and Russia at the start ofthe crisis on the political confrontation that focused on whether Ukraine should sign an association agreement with the European Union.'], ['Arg', 'O', 'For some reason, the European Union, with the support of the United States, rejected our proposal.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'When the 25 February agreement was reached, we supported it.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'We still believe that many of the 25 February positions are right, and that they must be kept to if we hope to bring Ukraine out of political crisis.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'We helped to conclude the 17 April Geneva agreement.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'It is a simple agreement, but it points to a way out of the crisis in the country.'], ['Arg', 'O', 'The one thing that is essential is that the agreement be fulfilled.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'But the most striking and infuriating thing is that the demands of the people of eastern Ukraine are basically fairly simple.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', "Finding themselves in a situation in which the nation's capital was occupied by an illegitimate authority, to a large degree consisting of hostile nationalist radical elements, the people asked that their rights be guaranteed."], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'They demanded federalization.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'It was noticeable that for a long period - almost two months after the overthrow of the lawful Government - no one there took up arms for at least a couple of months.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'They were all waiting for some constructive reaction from Kyiv to their demands for protecting their own interests.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'Not once did any kind of reasonable reaction or serious initiative emanate from Kyiv.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'Today some of our colleagues spoke approvingly of the most recent - today or yesterday - pronouncement of Mr. Yatsenyuk, in which he talked about 25 May, for which presidential elections are scheduled, and that there will be some kind of poll on decentralization of the country.'], ['O', 'O', 'A poll.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', "The people have been fighting on the barricades for weeks, and they think they have to conduct a poll in order to figure out people's opinion about what they want."], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'What bothered me more than anything today was how calmly and approvingly our Western colleagues spoke about the search operations that the Kyiv authorities are now carrying out in eastern Ukraine.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'They gave the impression that they know what the Kyiv authorities are thinking, what their plans are.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'Maybe they had a part in drawing up those plans, and that was why they talked about what was going on so calmly.'], ['O', 'Arg', 'Perhaps that should not be so surprising after all, because, as we know, every visit to Kyiv by senior American officials has resulted in events reaching new levels of confrontation, and a more violent turn of events.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'In that regard, it is not surprising that the United States, as I said in my statement, did not want the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to do as it was supposed to under the Vienna Document, that is, to bring about dialogue and organize a round table with representative of different regions and the Kyiv Government.'], ['O', 'Arg', 'Why did the United States not want the OSCE to do that?'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'Throughout the crisis, Russia several times has suggested different formats for the organization of such dialogue between the Government and opposition forces and regions.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'The Government did not want to or could not do it themselves.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'We suggested a constitutional assembly be convened.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'They said they were not ready to do so.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'When the meeting of 17 April was organized, we suggested that representatives of the regions should be included, and that the four parties - the European Union, the United States and Russia and the acting Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine - could start those talks.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'But that proposal was rejected.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'The OSCE was then given the mandate, which it tried to carry out only then to be told it should not.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'Instead, tanks were brought out to Sloviansk and other cities in the east of the country.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'Regarding what one colleague said, that Russia is refusing to implement the 17 April Geneva statement, I would repeat that Russia would never refuse to implement any useful document agreed upon during the crisis, including the 21 February agreement.'], ['Arg', 'O', 'Actually listening to my statement today, one would notice that the political components were quotations from the 17 April document.'], ['O', 'Arg', 'If we are truly intent on finding a political solution to the crisis in spite of the dramatic events of recent days, then perhaps we might ask the President, the Permanent Representative of Korea, to make a statement following this meeting, stating that the Security Council, in keeping with the 17 April Geneva statement, calls for a swift halt to the violence, including, of course, the use of force in eastern Ukraine, and appeals for the swift and comprehensive implementation of the Geneva statement.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'If other members would be ready to support such action, then we would too.'], ['O', 'O', 'I wouldjust like to offer a couple of points in response.'], ['O', 'Arg', 'First, for the Russians to blame Ukraine for Ukraine\'s actions in defence of its own people on its own territory really is starting to remind me of the story of the schoolboy who returned home with his nose bloody and his shirt torn and, asked by his mother how the fight started, he said "it started when the other boy hit me back".'], ['O', 'Arg', 'We have to be clear about cause and effect here, and many Council members, including me, have already gone through the facts that have brought us to this point.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'My second point is to debunk yet another of the lies that have been told in this Chamber, because it relates to my country, the United States.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'People in this Chamber have heard many times, including just now, that the United States and other countries never called oon protesters in the Maidan to leave buildings or avoid violence.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'The implication is that we are holding Russian separatists to a different standard.'], ['Arg', 'O', 'That is a claim that has been made in almost every meeting we have had.'], ['O', 'O', 'I would just like to correct the record.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'On 15 January, we condemned the actions of rioters outside a Kyiv court building on 10 January.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'On 22 January, the aggressive actions of members of the extreme-right group Pravy Sektor were unacceptable, enflaming conditions on the streets and undermining the efforts of peaceful protesters.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'We condemned the targeted attacks against journalists and unofficial groups such as Titushky.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'On 24 January, when protesters occupied some regional administration buildings, we reiterated our call for all protesters and Government forces to refrain from violence and the destruction of property.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'On 27 January, we made clear that we condemned the use of violence to seize Government buildings, such as the takeover of a Ministry of Justice building that took place over the past cople of days and of a public exhibition hall that weekend, and continued to reiterate our call for all protesters and Government forces to refrain from violence and the destruction of property.'], ['O', 'Arg', 'Those are just a few of the statements that we made, but if we could just take that particular lie of the table, it would be helpful and a little more constructive.'], ['Arg', 'O', 'What is more important now is where we go from here.'], ['Arg', 'O', 'What I would ask my Russian colleague is whether Russia will make public statements and work privately behind the scenes to urge Russian separatists to negotiate peacefully their departure from public buildings.'], ['O', 'O', 'Where does Russia assess that Russian separatists who claim loyalty to the Russian Government and who wear uniforms just like those of Russian soldiers obtained weapons and training capable of shooting down Ukrainian helicopters?'], ['Arg', 'O', 'Finally, Russia repeatedly takes aim at the so-called illegitimate Government in Kyiv but refuses to acknowledge ever, in any meeting, that it did not embrace the 21 February agreement when it was negotiated.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'We have a golden opportunity on 25 May for the people of eastern Ukraine to have their voices heard, for them to choose their own leaders and for us to get to a universally legitimate Government that is respected and chosen by all of the people of Ukraine.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'Yet Russia will not come out in support of the elections and work with us to ensure that they take place - which would be the best way of ensuring rights, representativeness and greater autonomy for the people of eastern Ukraine.'], ['Arg', 'O', "I did not want to say that a lie cannot only be a distortion of facts, but also a selective interpretation of one's own position."], ['O', 'O', 'That is what we have just heard from my American colleague.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'What we have heard from Washington, DC, and the way it was heard clearly demonstrated to all - including to those in Kyiv, which is most important - that the United States looked favourably on the forceful change of power, which did not ultimately serve the interests of the Ukrainian people.'], ['O', 'O', 'Regarding my proposal.'], ['Arg', 'O', '1 do think it would be good to conclude this meeting with such a statement, not asking every delegation what it is going to declare but rather make ajoint statement calling for a swift halt to all violence.'], ['Arg', 'O', 'including the use of military force in the cast of the country, and for seriously taking up the full implementation of the Geneva document.'], ['Arg', 'O', 'We meet today in the most tragic of circumstances.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'Yesterday, Malaysia Airlines passenger flight MH-l7 appears to have been shot down over eastern Ukraine, killing all passengers and crew.'], ['O', 'O', 'Our deepest, most heartfelt condolences go to the families of the victims and to the people and Governments of those countries affected.'], ['Arg', 'O', 'In the United Kingdom, we are mourning the loss of at least nine British citizens who were passengers on the flight.'], ['Arg', 'O', 'This is a dark moment for the international community.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'The senseless violence unleashed by armed separatists in eastern Ukraine has reached monstrous proportions.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'The precise circumstances and causes of this tragic event must be established quickly and beyond any doubt.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'As the Council has affirmed this morning, that will require a full, thorough and independent international investigation, in accordance with international civil aviation guidelines.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'The International Civil Aviation Organization, which provides the international legal framework for the investigation of air accidents, should have a central role to play in ensuring that there is credible and independent international involvement.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'We welcome the indications from the Ukrainian authorities that they want international investigators to join their efforts.'], ['Arg', 'O', 'The United Kingdom will provide whatever assistance is necessary to support that investigation.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'The immediate priority has to be for investigators to gain access to the crash site so they can start their work.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'They must be able to operate unhindered and in security.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'There must be no interference or tampering with the evidence.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'Armed separatist groups in the vicinity must allow such access.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'Despite assurances made yesterday evening, we understand that has not yet happened.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'We call on Russia to use its influence with those groups to ensure that it happens.'], ['Arg', 'O', 'The special monitoring mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe already present in eastern Ukraine can play a key role in facilitating and safeguarding access.'], ['O', 'O', 'Early indications are that Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-l7 was brought down by a surface-to-air missile.'], ['Arg', 'O', 'The MH-17 is not the first aircraft to be brought down in the area.'], ['Arg', 'O', 'On 14 June, armed separatists claimed responsibility for - indeed, gloated publicly over 4 the shooting down of a Ukrainian I1-76 transport aircraft, with a loss of all 49 aboard.'], ['Arg', 'O', 'On 14 July, armed separatists shot down an An-26 transport aircraft with a surface-to-air missile.'], ['Arg', 'O', 'And, on 16 July, a Ukrainian Su-25 jet was shot down in circumstances that have yet to be fully clarified.'], ['Arg', 'O', 'We have to ask searching questions about why we are now confronting this tragic situation.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'Russian officials have claimed that armed separatists in eastern Ukraine represent a spontaneous local insurgency.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'We know that is not the case.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', "We know that the three leading figures of the so-called Donetsk People's Republic are Russian citizens who have come from outside Ukraine."], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'We know that weapons, equipment and logistical support have been systematically provided to armed separatist groups by Russia, including up to 100 man-portable air defence systems and 15 to 25 main battle tanks, not to mention artillery pieces, rocket launchers and other armoured vehicles.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'The United Kingdom urges Russia to reflect carefully on the situation it has created.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'We urge Russia to cease its policy of supporting armed separatist groups and their violent actions of destabilizing a neighbouring country and of generating displacement and social and economic hardship.'], ['Arg', 'O', 'Let us hear today a clear and unequivocal condemnation from Russia of the actions of these armed groups.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'These armed groups do not represent the people of Ukraine; without Russian support, they would wither.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', "It is the Council's responsibility to respond to such tragedies by drawing the right lessons and working together with commitment and conviction to prevent their repetition."], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'It is clear where responsibility lies: with the senseless violence of armed separatists and with those who have supported, equipped and advised them.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'The Council must be united in condemning these actions and in demanding that these groups disarm, desist from violence and intimidation and engage in dialogue through the democratic mechanisms that are available to them.'], ['Arg', 'O', "They have been given opportunities to do so, most recently through President Poroshenko's peace plan."], ['Arg', 'O', 'Those opportunities have all been spurned.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'In the press statement agreed earlier today, the members of the Security Council expressed their condolences and called for an international investigation and appropriate accountability.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'That is welcome, but it is not enough.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'The Council must go further.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'It should come together behind a clear demand that the armed separatist groups should lay down their arms and pursue whatever political legitimate objectives they may have through exclusively peaceful and democratic means, and that the flow of arms, fighters and logistical support to the armed separatists be fully halted and the borders secured.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', "In the light of yesterday's tragedy, any other course of action would be unconscionable."], ['Arg', 'O', 'Yesterday we were all shocked by the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17.'], ['O', 'Arg', 'All 298 people aboard - 283 passangers and 15 crew members - were killed.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'As we stared at the passanger list yesterday, we saw next to three of the passangers\' names a capital "I".'], ['O', 'Arg', 'As we now know, that letter stands for "infant".'], ['O', 'O', 'To the families and friends of the victims, it is impossible to find words to express our condolences.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'We can only commit to them that we will not rest until we find out what happened.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'A full, credible and unimpeded international investigation must begin immediately.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'The perpetrators must be brought to justice; they must not be sheltered by any State Member of the United Nations.'], ['O', 'O', 'Let me share with the Council our assesment of the evidence so far.'], ['Arg', 'O', 'We assess that Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, carrying 298 people from Amsterdan to Kuala Lumpur, was likely downed by a surface-to-air missile (SAM) - an SA-11 - operated from a separatist-held location in eastern Ukraine.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'The airliner was travelling at a cruise altitude of 33,000 feet, and its speed was typical for an airliner along an established flight corridor frequented by commercial traffic.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'The flight was transmiting its assigned transponder code, corresponding with its flight plan, and flight tracking data was publicly available on the Internet.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'There was nothing threatening or provocative about MH-17.'], ['Arg', 'O', 'Of the operational SAM.'], ['Arg', 'O', "systems located near the border, only the SA-Il, SA-20 and SA-22 systems are capable of hitting an aircraft at the flight's altitude of 33,000 feet."], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'We can rule out shorter-range SAMSs known to be in separatist hands, including man-portable air defence systems, and SA-8 and SA-13 systems, which are not capable of hitting an aircraft at that altitude.'], ['O', 'O', 'Early Thursday, an SA-ll SAM.'], ['Arg', 'O', 'system was reported near Zahnitkiv by a western reporter, and separatists were spotted hours before the incident with an SA-Il system at a location close to the site where the plane went down.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'Separatists initially claimed responsibility for shooting down a military transport plane, and posted videos that are now being connected to the Malaysia Airlines crash.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'Separatist leaders also boasted on social media about shooting down a plane, but later deleted those messages.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'Because of the technical complexity of the SA-11, it is unlikely that the separatists could effectively operate the system without assistance from knowledgeable personnel.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'Therefore, we cannot rule out technical assistance from Russian personnel in operating the systems.'], ['Arg', 'O', 'The Ukrainians do have SA-ll systems in their inventory; however, we are not aware of any Ukrainian SAM.'], ['Arg', 'O', 'systems in the area of the shoot-down.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'More important, since the beginning of the crisis Ukrainian air defences have not fired a single missile, despite several alleged violations of their airspace by Russian aircraft.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'This also follows a pattern of actions by Russian-backed separatists.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'On 13 June, separatists shot down a Ukrainian transport plane carrying 40 paratroopers and 9 crew members.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', "On 24 June, as the Council was meeting to welcome Ukraine's unilateral ceasefire (see S/PV.7205), we received word that separatists had downed a Ukrainian helicopter, killing all nine aboard."], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'On 14 July, separatists claimed credit for downing a Ukrainian military cargo plane flying at 6,000 metres.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'And on 16 July they claimed credit for the downing of a Ukrainian fighter jet.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'If indeed Russian-backed separatists were behind this attack on a civilian airliner, they and their backers would have good reason to cover up evidence of their crime.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'It is therefore extremely important that an investigation be commenced immediately.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'In the first instance, the special monitoring mission the of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe should act as a first responder, thereby laying the foundation for efforts by other international organizations and individual nations, including those whose citizens were victims of the tragedy.'], ['Arg', 'O', "Yesterday, President Obama assured Ukraine's President Poroshenko that United States experts would offer all possible assistance upon his request."], ['Arg', 'O', 'President Poroshenko has invited the independent and credible International Civil Aviation Organization to join an investigation.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'International investigators must be granted immediate, full and unfettered access to the crash site.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'All those concerned - Russia, pro-Russian separatists and Ukraine - should agree to support an immediate ceasefire to facilitate access by international investigators.'], ['Arg', 'O', 'In that regard, we look to the monitoring misson also to reach agreement with separatists and others in the region to make that possible.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'All evidence must remain undisturbed and any evidence removed from the site by the Russian-backed separatists operating in the area should be promptly returned and handed over.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'Russia needs to help make that happen.'], ['Arg', 'O', 'While it make take us some time to firmly establish who shot down a plane filled with innocents,

repeatedly provided the Council with evidence of Russia's continued support to the separatists."], ['Arg', 'O', 'Time after time, we have called on the Russian Government to de-escalate the situation

time, President Putin has committed to working towards dialogue and peace - in Geneva in April, in Normandy in June and in Berlin earlier this month - and every single time he has broken that commitment.'], ['O', 'O', 'Here is what we know.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'In the past few weeks, Russia has increased the number of tanks, armoured vehicles and rocket launchers in south-west Russia.'],

Government, she was transferred to Russia by separatists.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'Russia continues to redeploy new forces extremely close to the Ukrainian border.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'In addition, on Monday,

Ukrainian Government believes that the planes were fired on from Russian territory.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'It is because of such continued destabilizing Russian actions that the United States imposed sanctions on the defence, energy and financial sectors of the Russian economy, including financial institutions.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', "The measures include freezing the assets ofRussian defence companies and blocking new financing of some of Russia's most important banks and energy companies."], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'The sanctions are significant, but they are also targeted and designed to have the maximum impact on the Russian calculus while limiting the impact on the Russian people and any spillover effects on our interests or those of our allies.'], ['Arg', 'O', 'This week, the European Union also announced expanded sanctions on Russia.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'The message is unified and clear: if President Putin continues to choose escalation over de-escalation, the international community will

in Moscow.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', "President Poroshenko's plan offered amnesty to separatists who voluntarily laid down their arms and who are not guilty of capital crimes."], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'He committed to providing a safe corridor for Russian fighters to return to Russia.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'He established a job-creation programme for the affected areas, made an offer of broad decentralization and

(OSCE), particularly in regard to the implementation of the provisions of the Minsk agreements regarding border monitoring.'], ['O', 'O', 'Since there have been accusations against Russia in that context, I wouldjust like to recall that the proposal to deploy OSCE observers at certain border crossing points was made by the Russian side in the context of the ceasefire.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'The ceasefire did not take place.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'However, we went even further.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'We said that, even in the absence of a ceasefire, we would be ready to deploy the observers on the Russian side of the Russian-Ukrainian border.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'That was a significant gesture by the Russian Federation, and any criticism in that regard is unacceptable.'], ['O', 'O', 'With regard to the issues being discussed by the OSCE in Vienna, I would like to recall that, as I noted in my statement, the Minsk protocol presupposes a certain sequence of steps that needs to be followed.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'The sequence is first and foremost based on the implementation of the ceasefire, which unfortunately did not take place.'], ['Arg', 'O', 'The Ukrainian representative made a very important appeal for an end to the shelling of areas where civilians live.'], ['Arg', 'O', 'Why does he not direct his appeal to his own side?'], ['Arg', 'O', 'He mentioned the insurgents.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'He asserted that civilians are dying as a result of such shelling.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'If that is the case, that is of course very unfortunate.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'However, civilians, sometimes as many as 19 people in one day, are dying in the Donbas region as a result of shells being fired by the Ukrainian Armed Forces.'], ['O', 'O', 'We note an interesting use of terms.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'The representative of Ukraine says that its armed forces are not responsible, but what about the battalions under Ukrainian command?'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'It seems that they are under such command but the impression is that they are not.'], ['O', 'Arg', 'Once again, our Ukrainian colleague could do no better than give an unverified version of events, according to which a separatist missile shot down the Malaysian Airlines flight.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'I want to reiterate that it is irresponsible to voice unverified accounts in the Security Council.'], ['O', 'O', 'In that context, I have two questions: how and why did that happen?'], ['O', 'O', 'I will explain.'], ['Arg', 'O', 'Everyone now knows that as soon as the tragedy occurred, rumours were circulated in Kyiv.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'False information that was supposed to affirm a particular version of events was given.'], ['O', 'O', 'Why was that done?'], ['O', 'Arg', 'Because if one has information, why not share it?'], ['O', 'Arg', 'Why keep it secret?'], ['Arg', 'O', 'That is just a very simple explanation.'], ['Arg', 'O', 'In the preliminary report that they provided to us, the Dutch experts said that the air traffic control recordings were routine and contained nothing of value.'], ['Arg', 'O', 'If they are routine, why not publish them just to demonstrate transparency?'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'What is more serious is the fact that our experts have drawn up some 40 important questions that need to be answered in order to understand what happened.'], ['O', 'Arg', 'The Ukrainian representative has made no attempt to reply to a single one of those questions.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'It is time for him to cease - in particular at Security Council meetings - his endless repetitions of unverified versions of events and to answer those questions.'], ['O', 'O', 'We would then be able to have a serious discussion.'], ['Arg', 'O', 'Otherwise, let us wait and try to conduct the investigation as seriously as possible, as we proposed on 19 September (see S/PV.7269).'], ['O', 'O', 'Mr. Quinlan (Australia): I will be extremely brief.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'I would like to agree with my Russian colleague on the importance of answering all questions that need to be answered in respect of the independent investigation that is currently under way with regard to Flight MH-l7.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'That investigation is independent.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'It is being undertaken by an independent body - the Dutch Safety Board.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'Participation in that investigation includes two Russian experts.'], ['Arg',

preliminary report so far but which continues.'], ['Arg', 'O', 'All participating Governments and other bodies, including the International Civil Aviation Organization, have been assured that it will be very proper and very systematic and will answer all the questions that have been raised.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'I therefore agree with my Russian colleague that such kinds of questions need to be looked at.'], ['Arg', 'O', 'Our understanding is that that is being done.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'But the fact is that we have an independent investigation.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'It enjoys the participation of all those who need to be involved, including Russian experts, and is being undertaken in accordance with accepted international guidelines, as affirmed to us in the briefing by Mr. Feltman that took place on 19 September (see S/PV.7269).'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'In terms of what I said in my earlier statement about the cause of the downing of the aircraft, what I said was that all the apparent evidence that has been produced so far, while not conclusive, is consistent with the initial assessment that that event, that atrocity, was consistent with a surface-to-air missile from the areas and in the terms that I mentioned.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'I did not assert that that was a definitive conclusion - certainly not yet - of the independent investigation, which is still looking to establish what happened rather than who was responsible.'], ['Arg', 'O', 'The prosecutorial investigations that are under way and that involve hundreds and hundreds of prosecutors from 13 countries, who are being coordinated by the Dutch Government, will seek to establish the culpability and then lay the basis for accountability.'], ['Arg', 'O', 'Those countries most directly affected that lost citizens in that outrage have all indicated consistently their confidence in both processes that are taking place.'], ['O', 'O', 'I have said enough but I just wanted to put that firmly on the record.'],

that group.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'As for the other allegations voiced by the Russian delegation, I regret that it continues to use such unconstructive rhetoric.'], ['O', 'O', 'I just want to reiterate our main message regarding the accusations levelled at the Government of Ukraine that our troops committed some crimes.'], ['Arg', 'O', 'We take very seriously all credible information about any crimes committed on the territory of Ukraine.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'The Government of Ukraine condemns all crimes, especially serious crimes in breach of international law.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'Any such crimes should be properly investigated.'], ['Arg', 'O', 'They will be investigated and those responsible will be held accountable sooner or later.'], ['Arg', 'O', 'Ukraine is open to cooperating with international partners in the investigation of such crimes.'], ['O', 'O', 'I hope that that position is quite clear.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'However, at the same time, it seems to me that Russia is casting such unfounded allegations against Ukraine in order to distract the attention of the international community from the main issue, which is the Russsian aggression against Ukraine and its interference into the domestic affairs of my country.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'The occupation of Crimea, the instigation of unrest in eastern Ukraine and the supply of weapons and manpower for the needs of the separatist movements in Ukraine are among the main causes of those dramatic events.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'Unfortunately, I have not heard from the Russian delegation a firm willingness to comply strictly with the Minsk arrangements, to which it is a party.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', "We have not heard any expression of Russia's firm intention to withdraw its troops from Ukraine or its readiness to cooperate with Ukraine in establishing effective control over the State border."], ['Arg', 'Arg', "We have not heard a condemnation of the serious crimes committed by the illegal armed groups, crimes that are clearly reflected in the United Nations Monitoring Mission's report."], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'We also had expected that Russia would condemn the intentions of the separatists to hold local elections on 2 November, an act that would Violate the Minsk arrangements, signed by Ukraine and Russia.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'It would be quite difficult to settle the situation in eastern Ukraine without addressing that issue, as noted in our statement today.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'The leadership of Ukraine has demonstrated by its deeds its readiness and willingness to work for a peaceful resolution.'], ['Arg',

English translation, but I think it will be useful.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'In connection with what our Australian colleague said, I do not think we need to have a broad discussion on the independent investigation, but I am very happy that he sounded so constructive about the investigation.'], ['O', 'O', 'I was concerned about one thing, however, on which I think we need to be very clear.'],

investigation.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'That simply is not the case.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'It was just a version constructed by the United States, which did not provide any justification.'], ['Arg', 'Arg',

few days after the tragedy, that same region was visited by a journalist from the Russian Service of the BBC, who gave a four-minute report from there, which clearly demonstrated that no one had shot any missiles from that location.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'However, that report was posted on the BBC website for only half a day and was then taken down.'], ['O', 'Arg', 'I suppose it was not considered

other countries today on the deteriorating situation in eastern Ukraine sounds familiar, it is for good reason.'], ['O', 'Arg', "For while the situation has evolved, the root of the problem remains the same: Russia's flagrant violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity."], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'Time and again, Russia has made commitments and then failed to live up to them, and subsequently offered explanations to the Council that it knows are untrue.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'The most recent example involves the joint commitments made by Russia, the separatists it supports and Ukraine on 5 September in Minsk.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'They include an immediate end to the ceasefire violations, the restoration of Ukrainian control of its side of the international border, OSCE monitoring of the border and a security zone on either side of the border, as well as the withdrawal of foreign forces, mercenaries and equipment from Ukraine and the release of hostages and prisoners.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'On none of those have Russia or the separatists lived up to their word.'], ['Arg', 'O', 'At Minsk, all sides committed to an immediate ceasefire.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'Yet, rather than observe the ceasefire, the separatists have taken advantage of the agreed-upon pause in the fighting to try and expand their territory beyond Minsk lines.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', "Meanwhile,

increased significantly, including on positions around Donetsk airport, the city of Debaltseve and,of course, near Mariupol.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'At Minsk, all sides committed to permitting the OSCE to monitor and verify the ceasefire.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', "Yet Russian- backed separatists have fired on OSCE monitoring drones and used jamming signals to interfere with its team members' electronics using equipment supplied by Moscow."], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'At Minsk, all sides agreed to permanent monitoring at the Ukrainian-Russian State border and the creation of a security zone along the border.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'Yet Russia has done nothing to restore Ukrainian Government control over the international border.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'Russia has refused to press separatists to allow the OSCE access to the border, and Russia continues to flout Ukrainian air space with its helicopters and unmanned aerial vehicles.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'It also continues to send so-called humanitarian convoys - convoys it will not allow Ukrainian customs authorities or international monitors to search.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'At Minsk, all sides committed to immediately free all hostages and illegally held persons.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'Yet Russia and the separatists it backs continue to hold approximately 500 captives.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'Those captives include Ukrainian pilot Nadia Savchenko and Ukrainian film director Oleg Sentsov, both of whom were captured by separatists on Ukrainian soil and illegally transported against their will to Russia.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'At Minsk, Russia committed to remove all illegal military formations, military equipment and militants from Ukraine.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'Yet, rather than withdrawing its military forces from Ukraine and rather than cutting off its support for separatists, Russia is instead surging more forces and more equipment across the border.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'The Russian military has maintained a forward presence in eastern Ukraine since the ceasefire took effect.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'We have information indicating that a Russian air-defence system was operating near one of the separatist convoys in Donetsk.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'Russia has not provided that type of air- defence system to separatists to date, suggesting that Russian forces were protecting the convoy.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'On 9 November, the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission

hours.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'The list goes on, but the pattern is clear.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'Where Russia has made commitments, it has failed to meet them.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'Russia negotiated a peace

show considerable restraint in response to constant provocation and attack.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'The Ukrainian people have repeatedly chosen leaders who call for de-escalation over escalation, first in the presidential election and then in parliamentary elections.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'Ukraine has also put in motion critically important reforms to reduce corruption and grant greater authority to its

the OSCE here today and United Nations, must be political.'], ['Arg', 'O', 'With Minsk we have a road map to reach that solution.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'The problem is, as it has long been throughout this crisis, you cannot reach a political solution if only one side is committed to forging it, and you cannot effectively implement a road map with parties who, like the Russians and the separatists they back, so consistently fail to keep their word.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', "We have seen Russia's playbook in Transnistria, South Ossetia, Abkhazia and Crimea - so the question is not what Russia will try to do

risk of the crisis spreading within Ukraine and beyond should not be underestimated.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', "Ukraine must therefore remain at the heart of the Security Council's priorities."], ['Arg', 'O',

ago.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'The parameters necessary for an end to the crisis are now known to all - namely, the Minsk agreements.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'Against all odds, and despite alternating periods of violence - as we see now - and quiet, that road map was upheld until last week.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'It is not challenged by the parties.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'Its implementation remains very difficult.'],

mechanism for validation and political impetus: the Normandy format.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'It seeks to encourage parties to go further and takes note of the progress made.'], ['O', 'Arg', 'However, much remains to be done, as the situation on the ground today makes tragically clear.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'We must move forward if we want diplomatic dynamics to prevail over violence and chaos.'], ['Arg',

tensions even as a diplomatic process begins."], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'We also call on Ukraine to launch a process leading to institutional reforms giving Donbas greater autonomy while respecting the sovereignty of Ukraine.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'We call once again on Russia to stop the transfer of arms and individuals across the Russian-Ukrainian border.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'We call on Russia to bring

border.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'Among this, we have heard the usual pattern of Russian denials and misinformation.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', "It is clear, just as it was when we last met, in November (see

the situation will only get worse, with the elderly, the young and the infirm all increasingly vulnerable.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'The separatists must allow Ukrainian humanitarian convoys to enter the regions they control, and Russia must stop using its unilateral humanitarian convoys as cover to supply those separatists with arms.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'The human rights situation gives equal cause for

days ago, two companies of Russian troops, including up to 30 armoured personnel carriers and a dozen tanks, were seen crossing the border into Ukraine.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'Daily we see Russian

that were reached in Minsk in September.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', "However, despite a number of diplomatic initiatives, including today's Normandy-format meeting, more than 1,000 people have been killed since those commitments were made in September, and separatists have taken control of a substantial additional area of Ukrainian territory since the September agreements."], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'Indeed, any analysis of the implementation of the Minsk agreements lays bare the manifest failure of Russia and the separatists to implement 10 out of the 12 commitments made on that occasion.'], ['Arg',

Minsk, but to redraft the line of control articulated in it.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'Russia and the separatists it supports should fulfil the commitments they made in September, rather than attempt to

implementation of Minsk, not more distractions from it.'], ['Arg', 'Arg', 'Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): I understand that Ms. Power decided that she had not been eloquent
