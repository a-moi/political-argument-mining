what i have proposed is something much better,Claim
its going to take discipline of the executive branch,Claim
its going to take discipline of the congressional branch,Claim
that is what i call a flexible freeze that allows growth about 4 percent or the rate of inflation but does not permit the congress just to add on spending,Premise

i think its unconscionable ann that we should be talking or thinking about imposing new taxes on average americans when there are billions out there over 100 billion in taxes owed that arent being paid,Claim
we can do all of those things and at the same time build a future in which we are standing on a good strong fiscal foundation,Claim
if you give any of us 200 billion worth of hot checks a year we can create an illusion of prosperity,Claim
sooner or later that credit card mentality isnt going to work,Claim
i want to bring to the white house a sense of strength and fiscal responsibility which will build a good strong foundation under which this country or above which country can move grow invest and build the best america for its people and for our kids and our grandkids,Premise

you should be quiet,Claim

i think im a little more lovable these days than i used to be back in my youth when i began in my state legislature,Claim
im also a serious guy,Claim
i think the presidency of the united states is a very serious office,Claim
i think we have to address these issues in a very serious way,Claim
i also think its important to be somebody who is willing to make those tough choices,Claim
within days after you made that pledge you broke it,Premise
hes not going to raise taxes,Claim
you supported legislation this year thats involved tax increases not once but twice,Premise

he is going to have to work with the congress seriously,Claim
he cant turn to the congress and blame them for the fact that we dont have a balanced budget and that we have billions and billions of dollars in red ink,Premise
i am going to be a president who is serious,Claim
to do the kind of job that im elected to do will do it with as much good humor as i can,Claim
i think we know what they are,Claim
i dont think its a question of whether people like you or not to make you an effective leader,Claim
i think its whether you share the broad dreams of the american people,Claim
whether you have confidence in the peoples ability to get things done,Claim
i think its a question of values not likability or loveability,Claim
its a question in foreign affairs in experience,Claim
youd know exactly how to begin,Premise
you have to learn from experience that making unilateral cuts in defense system is not the way that you enhance peace,Premise
it is only the united states that can stand for freedom and democracy around the world,Claim
we cant turn it over to the united nations or other multilateral organizations,Claim
it is though trying to understand the heartbeat of the country,Premise
i think id be a better president now for having had to travel to these communities and understand the family values and the importance of neighborhood,Claim
these campaigns get knocked a lot,Premise
the tenor of the campaign youve been running in terms of both the issues and your rhetoric has surprised even some of your friends,Claim
senator mark hatfield whos known your family a long time and who knew your father the late senator prescott bush said and i quote if his father were alive today im sure his father would see it as a shocking transformation,Premise
i think my dad would be pretty proud of me,Claim
weve come a long long way,Premise
what ive had to do is define not just my position but to define his,Claim
i didnt do that,Claim
im not the one that compared the president of the united states rotting from like a dead fish from the head down,Claim
he ran on the left in the democratic primary ran firmly and ran with conviction and ran on his record,Premise
then at that democratic convention they made a determination and they said there ideology doesnt matter just competence,Premise
in the process the negatives began,Premise
it wasnt me that was there at that convention,Premise
i was up in the with jimmy baker camping out,Premise
i have defined the issues,Claim
hes the one that brought up to garner primary votes the whole question of the aclu,Premise
and i have enormous difference with the aclu on their politic agenda,Premise
not on their defending some minority opinion on the right or the left,Premise
i support that,Claim
what i dont like is this left wing political agenda,Premise
i have to help define that,Claim
if hes unwilling to do it if he says ideology doesnt matter i dont agree with him,Premise
i guess the vice president two or three times said i was coming from the left,Premise
weve heard it again tonight and im not surprised the labels,Premise
in 1980 president reagan called you a liberal for voting for federal gun control,Premise
this is something republicans have used for a long time,Premise
they tried it with franklin roosevelt and harry truman and john kennedy,Premise
its not labels,Claim
its our vision of america,Claim
we have two fundamentally different visions of america,Claim
the vice president is complacent,Premise
i dont,Claim
i think this is a great country,Claim
weve always wanted to do better to make our country better to make our lives better,Premise
weve always been a nation which was ambitious for america and we move forward,Premise
thats the kind of leadership i want to provide,Claim
thats the kind of america i want,Claim
i dont think these labels mean a thing,Claim
the heart of the matter is the future of this country,Claim
they wouldnt be in the budget,Claim
ill give you one that hmet that heavy truck thats cost what is it 850 million and the pentagon didnt request it and yet a member of congress a very powerful one put it in the budget,Premise
i think we can save money through this whole very sophisticated concept andrea that i know you do understand of competitive strategies,Claim
it is new and it is very very different than whats happened,Premise
its very important,Claim
its not a question of saying our budget is full of a lot of waste,Claim
i dont believe that,Claim
i just think it would be dumb negotiating policy with the soviets to cut out one or the other of the two options right now,Claim
we are moving forward with negotiations,Premise
the soviets are modernizing,Premise
we cant simply weve got enough nuclear weapons,Claim
we cant do that,Claim
were in the serious stages of negotiation with the soviet union on the strategic arms control talks,Premise
were protecting a couple of options in terms of modernizing our strategic forces,Premise
my secretary of defense is going to have to make a very difficult decision in which system to go forward with,Claim
we are protecting both of them,Premise
we have to have modernization,Claim
i believe we can have the strongest and best defense possible,Claim
something we havent had over the course of the past many years,Claim
the vice president has been at least allegedly in charge of that war,Premise
we have the lowest murder rate of any industrial state in america,Premise
theres no way that we can build all of the weapons the vice president says he wants to build within the defense budget,Claim
weve just had another example of why the vice presidents mathematics just dont add up,Premise
we are not going to spend the billions and trillions that mr bush wants to spend on star wars,Claim
were not going to spend billions on mxs on railroad cars,Claim
were not going to spend hundreds of millions on a space plane from washington to tokyo,Claim
were going to have a strong and credible and effective nuclear deterrent,Claim
those are decisions that the chief executive has to make,Premise
everybody knows that including the people at the pentagon,Premise
my defense secretary is going to have a lot to do with those decisions,Premise
were going to go forward with the stealth and the d5 and the advance cruise missile and good conventional forces,Claim
im prepared to make them,Claim
the vice president is not,Claim
you say we have to do something about conventional forces,Claim
from jerry ford to jimmy carter to ronald reagan there has been a bipartisan consensus in favor of modernizing the land based missiles,Premise
you have ruled out the mx and the midgetman,Premise
more recently some of your aides have hinted at some flexibility you might show about some other new form of missile,Premise
you cant divorce our military security from our economic security,Claim
that debt is going to grow bigger and bigger and bigger,Claim
military security and economic security go hand in hand,Claim
i dont rule out modernization,Claim
there are discussions going on now in the congress i know with the pentagon about a less expensive modernized landbased leg of the triad,Premise
there are limits to what we can spend,Premise
there are limits to this nations ability to finance these weapons systems,Premise
we will have a strong and effective and credible nuclear deterrent,Claim
were going to have conventional forces that are well maintained well equipped well trained well supported,Claim
we have serious problems with our conventional forces at the present time,Premise
theyll get worse unless we have a president who is willing to make some of these decisions,Claim
we also have important domestic priorities in education and housing and health care in economic development in job training in the environment,Premise
all of these things are going to have to be addressed,Claim
i want the men and women of our armed forces to have the support they need to defend us,Premise
the support they need when they risk our lives to keep us free and to keep this country free,Premise
we cannot continue to live on a credit card,Claim
we cannot continue to tell the american people that were going to build all of these systems and at the same time invest in important things here at home and be serious about building a strong and good america,Premise
thats the kind of america i want to build,Claim
i think the foremost responsibility of a president really gets down to the national security of this country,Claim
they were wrong,Claim
and the result is we deployed and the soviets kept deploying and then we negotiated from strength,Premise
the governor talks about limits what we cant do,Premise
it takes eight years ten years to do that,Premise
now we have the first arms control agreement in the nuclear age to ban weapons,Premise
you just dont make unilateral cuts in the naive hope that the soviets are going to behave themselves,Premise
we have enhanced the peace,Claim
peace through strength works,Claim
hes a hero,Claim
i can think of doctors and scientists jonas salk who for example discovered a vaccine which cured one of the most dread diseases we ever had,Premise
there are many people who i admire in this country today,Claim
some of them are in public life in the senate the congress,Premise
some of my fellow governors who are real heroes to me,Premise
i think of those young athletes who represented us at the olympics were tremendously impressive,Premise
i think of classroom teachers classroom teachers that i have had classroom teachers that youngsters have today who are real heroes to our young people,Premise
they inspire them,Premise
they teach them,Premise
they are role models,Premise
members of the clergy who have done the same,Premise
drug counselors out there in the street who are providing help to youngsters who come up to me and others who ask for help and want help are doing the hard work the heroic work which it takes to provide that kind of leadership that kind of counseling that kind of support,Premise
i think of people in the law enforcement community who are taking their lives in their hands everyday when they go up to one of those doors and kick it down and try to stop this flow of drugs into our communities and into our kids,Premise
there are many many heroes in this country today,Claim
these are people that give of themselves everyday and every week and every month,Premise
in many cases they are people in the community who are examples and are role models,Premise
i also think we ought to give a little credit to the president of the united states,Claim
he is the one who has gotten us that first arms control agreement,Premise
he is leaving office with a popularity at an alltime high,Claim
american people say he is our hero,Premise
i think of a teacher right here largely hispanic school jaime escalante teaching calculus to young kids 80 percent of them going on to college,Premise
i think of a young man now in this country named villadaris who was released from a cuban jail,Premise
came out and told the truth in this brilliant book against all hope about what is actually happening in cuba,Premise
i think of those people that took us back into space again rick houk and that crew as people that are worthy of this,Premise
i agree with the governor on athletics,Premise
i think of dr fauci,Premise
hes a very fine research top doctor at the national institute of health working hard doing something about research on this disease of aids,Premise
i think the man anybody that gets into this political arena and has to face you guys everyday deserves a word of praise,Claim
its gotten a little ugly out there,Premise
its gotten a little nasty,Premise
its not much fun sometimes,Premise
no,Claim
weve got to unleash the bush kids,Claim
so you saw ten grandchildren there jumping all over their grandfather at the convention,Premise
you see our five kids all over this country and their spouses,Premise
the concept of the dukakis family has my great respect,Claim
we used that as a role model the way he took understandable pride in his heritage what his family means to him,Premise
some of it is unfair,Claim
ive been in politics a long time and i dont remember that kind of piling on that kind of ugly rumor that never was true printed,Premise
hes in the arena,Premise
teddy roosevelt used to talk about the arena you know daring to fail greatly or succeed no matter,Premise
hes in there,Premise
thats not bad,Claim
thats true,Claim
those are basic american values,Claim
i believe in them,Premise
i think you believe in them,Premise
theyre not left or right,Claim
theyre decent american values,Claim
one thing that concerns me about this ann is this attempt to label things which all of us believe in,Premise
we may have different approaches,Premise
we may think that you deal with them in different ways,Premise
theyre basically american,Claim
i think the american people would appreciate that,Claim
you regard abortion as murder yet you would make exceptions in the case of rape and incest,Claim
i dont think that you make an exception based on medical knowledge at the time,Claim
barb and i lost a child you know that we lost a daughter robin,Premise
i was over running records in west texas and i got a call from her come home,Premise
thanks to the miraculous sacrifice of doctors and nurses the child stayed alive for six months and then died,Premise
if that child were here today and i was told the same thing my granddaughter noel for example that child could stay alive for ten or fifteen years or maybe for the rest of her life,Premise
when i was in that little church across the river from washington and saw our grandchild christened in our faith i was very pleased indeed that the mother had not aborted that child and put the child up for adoption,Premise
i just feel this is where im coming from,Premise
i dont assail him on that issue or others on that issue,Claim
thats the way i george bush feel about it,Premise
i think it has to be the woman in the exercise of her own conscience and religious beliefs that makes that decision,Claim
thats a decision that only a woman can make,Claim
you would maintain a stable defense budget,Claim
you are on the board of a group called jobs with peace in boston that advocates a 25percent cut in the defense budget and the transfer of that money to the domestic economy,Premise
no i dont happen to share that goal,Claim
its an example of how oftentimes we may be associated with organizations all of whose particular positions we dont support,Premise
yes at some point it may be possible to reduce defense outlays and use those for important things here at home like jobs and job training and college opportunity and health and housing and the environment and the things that all of us care about,Premise
i do think this that the next president even within a relatively stable budget and thats what we are going to have for the foreseeable future will have to make those tough choices that i was talking about and that mr bush doesnt seem to want to make,Claim
that really is going to be a challenge for the next president of the united states,Claim
i think we have an opportunity over the long haul to begin to move some of our resources from the military to important domestic priorities,Claim
i also see a tremendous opportunity now to negotiate with the soviet union to build on the progress that weve made with the inf treaty which i strongly supported and most democrats did to get those reductions in strategic weapons to get a test ban treaty,Premise
provide college opportunity for that young woman whose mother wrote me from texas just the other day from longview texas two teachers a mother and a father who have a child thats a freshman in college an electrical engineering major a very bright student and they cant afford to keep that child in college,Premise
i hope that we can begin to move those resources,Premise
its not going to happen overnight,Claim
it certainly will have to happen on a stepbystep basis as we make progress in arms negotiation and arms control and arms reduction,Premise
it certainly ought to be the longterm goal of all americans,Claim
i do believe in the death penalty,Claim
i think it is a deterrent,Claim
i believe we need it,Claim
some crimes are so heinous so brutal so outrageous and id say particularly those that result in the death of a police officer,Premise
i think were facing a real opportunity for world peace,Claim
its a question as to whether the united states will continue to lead for peace,Premise
i dont believe any other country can pick up the mantel,Claim
the defense budget today takes far less percentage of the gross national product than it did in president kennedys time for example moved tremendously,Premise
i served at the un,Premise
i dont think we can turn over these kinds of decisions of the collective defense to the united nations or anything else,Claim
we are going to have to make choices,Claim
i said i would have the secretary of defense sit down,Premise
while the president is negotiating with the soviet union i simply do not want to make these unilateral cuts,Premise
i think those that advocated the freeze missed the point that there was a better way,Claim
the soviets take out more than we do and the principle of intrusive verification,Premise
those two principles can now be applied to conventional forces to strategic forces provided we dont give away our hand before we sit down at the head table,Premise
we dont have an alternative,Claim
fm going to have to,Claim
we have had not one but two detailed studies which indicate that there are billions and billions of dollars to be collected that are not being paid,Premise
well lose it when its taken out of our paycheck before we even get it,Premise
its the internal revenue service which estimates now that we arent collecting 100 billion or more in taxes owed in this country,Premise
that is just absolutely unfair to the vast majority of americans,Claim
the dorgan task force which included two internal revenue commissioners one a republican one a democrat,Premise
youve got to have a president whos prepared to do this and to begin right away,Claim
in my own state we did it,Premise
in other states weve done it,Premise
republican governors as well as democratic governors,Premise
weve had great success at revenue enforcement,Premise
this is something that we must begin,Claim
its going to take at least the first year of the new administration,Claim
the vice president will probably tell you that its going to take an army of irs collectors again,Premise
his campaign manager who used to be the secretary of the treasury was taking great credit about a year ago and asking and receiving from the congress substantial additional funds to hire internal revenue agents to go out and collect these funds,Premise
im happy to join jim baker in saying that we agree on this,Premise
the dorgan task force the bipartisan task force estimated that we could collect about 35 billion in the fifth year 105 billion over five years,Premise
the other study even more than that,Premise
thats where you begin,Claim
i believe we can keep this longest expansion going,Claim
i was not out there when that stock market dropped wringing my hands and saying this was the end of the world as some political leaders were,Claim
it isnt the end of the world,Premise
what we have to do is restrain the growth of spending,Claim
we are doing a better job of it,Premise
the congress is doing a better job of it,Premise
the dynamics work,Premise
they dont work if you go raise taxes and then the congress spends it continues to spend that,Claim
the american working man and woman are not taxed too little,Claim
the federal government continues to spend too much,Claim
more so you than me,Claim
it wasnt created as a welfare program,Claim
it wasnt created that is it was created as a whole retirement or supplement to retirement program,Claim
it wasnt created as a welfare program,Claim
we came into office and the social security trust fund was in great jeopardy,Premise
heres whats happened,Premise
you got to go back to what social security was when it was created,Premise
i dont want to fool around with it,Premise
theres a good political reason,Claim
its just about this time of year that the democrats start saying the republicans are going to take away your social security,Premise
it always works that way,Claim
ive seen it,Premise
in precinct politics in texas and ive seen it at the national level,Premise
we have made the social security trust fund sound,Premise
it is going to be operating at surpluses,Claim
i dont want the liberal democratic congress to spend out of that social security trust fund or go and take the money out for some other purpose,Premise
i will not go in there and suggest changes in social security,Claim
the governor and i both supported slipping the colas for one year,Claim
i learned that the hard way,Premise
he supported it at the national governors conference,Premise
i supported it in breaking a tie in a major compromise package,Premise
i am going to keep that social security trust fund sound,Claim
maybe down the line maybe when you get two decades or one into the next century youre going to have to take another look at it,Premise
not now,Claim
we do not have to do it,Claim
you did it in 1985,Premise
republicans once theyre elected and start cutting,Claim
the administration tried to do it repeatedly repeatedly in 81 82,Premise
youll try to do it again,Claim
theres no way you can finance what you want to spend,Claim
theres no way you can pay for that five year 40 billion tax cut for the rich and still buy all those weapons systems you want to buy unless you raid the social security trust fund,Premise
george bush a few years ago said that social security was basically a welfare system,Premise
in 1985 he flew back from the west coast to cut that cola,Premise
i voted against that at the national governors association,Premise
we won a majority we didnt win the twothirds that was necessary nor to pass that resolution,Premise
i dont have a list yet,Claim
i feel pretty confident tonight but not that confident,Premise
i dont have any litmus test,Claim
what i would do is appoint people to the federal bench that will not legislate from the bench who will interpret the constitution,Claim
i do not want to see us go to again and fm using this word advisedly a liberal majority that is going to legislate from the bench,Premise
i wont support judges like that,Claim
they dont like the use of the word,Premise
there is no litmus test on any issue,Claim
i will go out there and find men and women to interpret,Claim
i dont have a list,Claim
i think the appointments that the president has made to the bench have been outstanding outstanding appointments,Claim
yeah,Claim
i supported him,Premise
that is a very good reason for voting for mike dukakis and lloyd bentsen on the 8th of november,Claim
i think the vice president supported the bork nomination,Premise
mr bush has never appointed a judge,Premise
ive appointed over 130,Premise
i have a record,Claim
i dont ask people whether theyre republicans or democrats,Premise
ive appointed prosecutors,Premise
i dont appoint people i think are liberal or people who think  who i think are conservative,Premise
i appoint people of independence and integrity and intelligence,Claim
those are the standards that i will use in nominating people to the supreme court of the united states,Claim
the government just cant continue to pay for all of those programs as theyre currently constituted,Claim
millions of americans are entitled to some of the protections and benefits that the federal government provides including social security pensions medicare for the elderly medicaid for the poor,Premise
twothirds of the people in this country who receive social security checks live entirely on that check,Premise
they have no other income,Premise
we now have catastrophic health insurance,Claim
its going to cost,Claim
thats going to be an additional burden on elderly citizens,Claim
mr bush tried to cut their cost of living increase in 1985,Premise
medicare is not getting less expensive,Premise
medical care for the elderly is getting more expensive with greater deductibles with fewer benefits the kinds of things weve had under this administration that have cut and chopped and reduced the kind of benefits that one gets under medicare,Premise
im not going to begin and im not going to go to entitlements as a means for cutting that deficit,Claim
were spending billions on something like star wars,Premise
were spending billions on other weapon systems which apparently the vice president wants to keep in his back pocket or some place,Premise
those are going to be additional costs on senior citizens across this country,Claim
it should have had bipartisan support,Premise
it had bipartisan support,Premise
there are some things we can do to help people who currently do get entitlements to get off public assistance,Claim
im proud to say that we finally have a welfare reform bill,Premise
thats the way you bring a deficit down and help to improve the quality of life for people at the same time,Claim
i did not vote to cut colas,Claim
i voted the same way that he did three months before in a national governors conference,Premise
he said at that time in a quote and this is a paraphrase a freeze thats easy,Premise
i dont believe that we need to do what youve suggested here,Claim
im going to keep this social security entitlement to keep that trust fund sound,Claim
i do think there are flexible ways to solve some of the pressing problems particularly that affect our children,Claim
i have made some good sound proposals,Claim
we have a big difference on child care for example,Premise

i think we know well whos going to help clean up this environment,Claim
i am one who played a very major role in passing the superfund legislation,Claim
we are the authors the democratic party of clean air of clean water of the superfund,Claim
every environmental organization that i know every major one has now endorsed the dukakisbentsen ticket,Claim
i am one who has just received the environmental award in texas for the work ive done to clean up the bays to clean up the water off the coast of texas,Claim
dukakis and bentsen will be committed to that,Claim
the record is there the history is there,Premise
you may be surprised tom they didnt ask me those questions on those votes,Claim
they were glad that i took time out of my schedule to go down and to talk about how we are going to get a food bank going and making sure that a food bank goes in fort wayne indiana,Premise
i have a very good record and a commitment to the poor to those that dont have a family that want to have a family,Claim
this administration and a george bush administration will be committed to eradicating poverty,Claim
poverty hasnt gone up in this administration,Claim
it hasnt gone down much either,Claim
that means we have a challenge ahead of us,Claim
what we have done for the poor is that we in fact  the homeless bill the mckinney act which is the major piece of legislation that deals with homeless  the congress has cut the funding that the administration has recommended,Claim
let me tell you something what we have done for the poor,Claim
to help the poor well have a commitment to the programs and those programs will go on,Claim
we are spending more in poverty programs today than we were in 1981  that is a fact,Claim
the poverty program we are going to concentrate on is creating jobs and opportunities,Claim
everyone will have the opportunities that they want,Claim
the poor and the poverty  the biggest thing that we have done for poverty in america is the tax simplification act of 1986,Claim
six million working poor families got off the payroll,Claim
six million people are off the taxpaying payrolls because of that tax reform and they are keeping the tax money there,Claim
i find that very interesting,Claim
he has been of no help at all when it comes to passing the most major welfare reform bill in the history of our country one where we are working very hard to see that people can get off welfare break that cycle take a step up in life doing the kinds of things that we did there to let them have medicaid for a year,Premise
thats a positive thing thats done,Claim
i dont really believe that that is identifying with the concerns of people in poverty,Claim
what also frustrates me with the kind of report that i have just heard here is the kind of votes that he has cast against child nutrition programs,Claim
the fact that he has voted against money that we needed for further immunization the denial of polio shots to kids where the parents couldnt afford to get that kind of a shot,Claim
dukakis and i have disagreed on the contra program,Claim
i really think we have to give peace a chance,Claim
my big difference with this administration is they look at the contra aid program as the only way to resolve that problem,Claim
they concentrate on that,Premise
thats why i have been a strong supporter of the arias plan,Claim
a plan that won the nobel prize for president arias the president of costa rica,Claim
i believe you have to work with the leaders of those other central american countries to try to bring about the democratization of nicaragua  by negotiation by pressure by counseling by diplomatic pressure that we ought to be trying that first,Claim
those are the kinds of things that wed be committed to in a dukakisbentsen administration to try to make this world a better place in which to live,Claim
those are the positive things i think we could do to bring about peace in that area to help raise that standard of living and give them the kind of stability where democracy can proceed and can prosper and bloom,Claim
we believe that we ought to be working with a new alliance for progress bringing in other countries to help bring in europeans the spanish who have a real affinity for that area bringing in the japanese who have a great surplus now and looking for places to invest it,Claim
in concentrating so much just on the contras,Premise
this administration has not paid enough attention to the rest of central america,Claim
the concern i have is that we have a country with 85 million people sharing a 2000mile border with us with half of those people under the age of 15 a country thats had its standard of living cut 50 percent in the last six years,Claim
we ought to be concerned about that,Claim
we ought to be involved,Claim
i was born and reared on that mexican border,Premise
i speak their language,Premise
ive spent a good part of my life down there,Premise
dukakis speaks spanish too,Premise
hes spent a good deal of time in central and south america,Premise
that is unfortunate,Claim
theres no doubt in a dukakis administration that the aid would be cut off to the democratic resistance in nicaragua,Claim
it is beyond me why its okay for the soviet union to put in billions of dollars to prop up the communist sandinistas,Premise
somehow its wrong for the united states to give a few dollars to the democratic resistance,Claim
the governor of massachusetts is simply out of step with mainstream america,Claim
he criticized our rescue mission in grenada,Claim
according to a upi report,Premise
theres another issue that michael dukakis is wrong on in central america and thats grenada,Claim
senator bentsen talked about the entire central america,Premise
i think they believe in the monroe doctrine,Claim
i doubt if many americans agree with that,Claim
theres a thing called the monroe doctrine something that the governor of massachusetts has said has been superseded,Premise
no,Claim
i dont find it embarrassing at all,Claim
you have to remember that pac money is the result of the last campaign reform bill one that talks about employees have greater participation,Premise
what ive done in pac money is just what my opponent in my campaign has done in his campaign,Claim
what you have to do is comply with the laws as they are whether youre paying taxes or youre playing a football game,Claim
he has been raising pac money too,Claim
i wish that senator quayle would change his mind on that particular piece of legislation and give us the kind of a campaign reform law that i think is needed in america,Claim
campaign reform changing the rules of the game is something we tried repeatedly in this session of the congress but only to have the republicans lead the charge against us and defeat us,Claim
i think its a loophole frankly,Claim
the things we have to do i believe that will cut back on soft money,Claim
for example which i look on as frankly one of those things that weve had to do because the republicans have done it for so long,Premise
ive noticed that the senator from indiana has opposed that campaign reform and voted repeatedly against it,Claim
i believe that we have to do some things in that regard,Claim
i have been for campaign reform and have pushed it very hard,Claim
whether you like those laws or not you comply with them,Claim
senator bentsen is the number one pac raiser,Claim
as a matter of fact he used to have a 10000 breakfast club,Claim
im sure they werent paying to have cornflakes,Claim
ill tell you the kind of campaign reform im supporting senator bentsen,Claim
i think its time we get rid of pac money,Claim
it only costs high paid lobbyists special interests in washington to come down and have breakfast with the chairman of the senate finance committee the one that oversees all the tax loopholes in the tax code 10000,Premise
support our legislation where we totally eliminate contributions by special interests and political action committees,Claim
lets have the individual contribute and the political parties contribute,Claim
thats the kind of campaign reform that republicans are for,Claim
they want to get rid of this special interest and rely on the individuals and also the political parties,Claim
i think this question keeps going back to the qualifications and what kind of vice president in this hypothetical situation if i had to assume the responsibilities of president what i would be,Claim
ive added ten years to my age age alone is not the only qualification,Claim
as i have said age alone although i can tell you after the experiences of these last few week in the campaign,Premise
youve got to look at experience,Claim
youve got to look at accomplishments,Claim
can you make a difference,Claim
have i made a difference in the united states senate where ive served for eight years yes i have,Claim
have i made a difference in the congress that ive served for 12 years yes i have,Claim
i am delighted that it comes up,Claim
on the three most important challenges facing america arms control and national security jobs and education and budget deficit,Premise
i have more experience and accomplishments than does the governor of massachusetts,Claim
i have been in the congress and ive worked on these issues,Claim
believe me when you look at arms control and trying to deal with the soviet union you cannot come at it from a naive position,Claim
you have to understand the soviet union,Claim
you have to understand how they will respond,Claim
sitting on that senate armed services committee for eight years has given me the experience to deal with the soviet union and how we can move forward,Claim
that is just one of the troubling issues thats going to be facing this nation,Claim
im prepared,Claim
i cant leave something on the table that hes charged me with,Claim
lets get to that one,Claim
i formed it,Claim
i closed it down almost immediately,Claim
i thought the perception was bad,Claim
when you talk about the breakfast club as you know that was perfectly legal,Premise
its the same law that lets you invite high priced lobbyists down to williamsburg,Claim
theres no control over what you do with that money,Claim
you can spend it on anything you want to,Premise
you can spent it on golf club dues if you want to do that,Premise
thats what ive seen you do in this administration,Claim
thats why we need campaign reform laws and why i support them,Claim
you in turn have voted against them time and time again,Premise
i disagree with that,Claim
the premise of your question john is that somehow this administration has been lax in enforcement of the osha regulations,Premise
well continue to do that,Claim
we believe in the market,Claim
we believe in the people,Claim
yes theres a role of government and the role of government is to make sure that those safety  and health and the welfare of the people is taken care of,Claim
we have produced 17 million jobs in this country since 1982,Claim
there is a commitment and there will always be a commitment to the safety of our working men and women,Claim
they deserve it,Claim
were committed to them,Claim
let me tell you this for the record when we have found violations in this administration there has not only been tough enforcement but there have been the most severe penalties  the largest penalties in the history of the department of labor  have been levied when these violations have been found,Claim
in my judgment deregulation has worked,Claim
the broader question goes to the whole issue of deregulation and has deregulation worked or has deregulation not worked,Premise
we have a deregulated economy and we have produced through low taxes not high taxes through deregulation  the spirit of entrepreneurship the individual going out and starting a business the businessman or women willing to go out and risk their investments to start up a business and hire people,Claim
deregulation as a form of political philosophy is a good philosophy,Claim
i think you see once again a piece of democratic legislation thats been passed to try protect the working men and women of america,Claim
a good example of that is the environmental protection laws that we were talking about a moment ago,Claim
thats why its important that you have people that truly believe and trying to represent the working men and women of america,Claim
this administration came in and put in a james watt an ann gorsuch now thats the bonnie and clyde really of environmental protection,Premise
then youve seen an administration that came in and really didnt have its heart in that kind of an enforcement,Claim
thats why you have to have osha,Claim
thats why you have to have tough and good and fair enforcement of it,Claim
thats what a democratic administration would do to help make this working place a safer and better place to be employed,Claim
most employers do a good job of that but some of them put their profits before people,Premise
ive supported that,Claim
i voted for the 50000 limitation to get away from the million dollar contributions to farmer,Claim
i think i understand their concerns and their problems,Claim
you know of the four that are on this ticket im the only on that was born and reared on a farm and still involved in farming,Premise
i feel very strongly that we ought to be doing more for the american farmer and what weve seen under this administration is neglect of that farmer,Claim
weve seen them drive 220000 farmers off the farm,Claim
we ought not to be doing that,Claim
they seem to think the answer is move them to town,Premise
were seeing rural hospitals close all over the country because of this kind of an administration,Claim
weve seen an administration that has lost much of our market abroad,Claim
they have not had a trade policy,Premise
we saw our market loss by some 40 percent,Claim
thats one of the reasons that weve seen the cost of the farm program which was only about two and a half billion dollars when they took office now go to about 25 billion,Claim
we can bring that kind of a cost down and get more to market prices if well have a good trade policy,Claim
we would be pushing very hard to open up those markets and stand up for the american farmer and see that we recapture those foreign markets,Claim
i think we can do it with the dukakisbentsen administration,Claim
ill tell you one way that were not going to recapture the foreign markets and that is if in fact we have another jimmy carter grain embargo,Claim
you know what the farmers interested in net farm income,Claim
every one percent in increase in interest rates a billion dollars out of the farmers pocket,Claim
another thing that a farmer is not interested in and thats supply management that the democratic platform talks about,Claim
net farm income increased inflation another billion dollars,Claim
i think the american farmer rightfully will reject,Claim
to come in and to tell our farmers not to grow corn not to grow soybeans thats the kind of farm policy youll get under a dukakis administration,Claim
thats what he and his harvard buddies think of the american farmer grow belgium endive,Claim
he went to the farmers in the midwest and told them not to grow corn not to grow soybeans but to grow belgium sic endive,Premise
the governor of massachusetts he has a farm program,Premise
if you let me write 200 billion worth of hot checks every year i could give you an illusion of prosperity too,Claim
this is an administration that has more than doubled the national debt and theyve done that in less than eight years,Claim
they have taken this country from the no 1 lender nation in the world to the no 1 debtor nation in the world,Premise
the interest on that debt next year on this reaganbush debt of our nation is going to be 640 for every man woman and child in america because of this kind of a creditcard mentality,Claim
we go out and we try to sell our securities every week and hope that the foreigners will buy them,Claim
every time they do we lose some of our economic independence for the future,Claim
they do buy them,Premise
we need an administration that will turn this trade policy around and open up those markets stand tough with our trading partners to help keep the jobs at home and send the products abroad,Claim
what we need in this country is someone like mike dukakis who gave ten balanced budgets in a row there and was able to do that meet that kind of a commitment set those tough priorities,Claim
the ultimate irony would be to have that happen to us,Claim
foreigners finally quit buying our securities,Premise
i dont believe that thats the kind of policy that we want,Claim
we are going to build on that change,Claim
i will address the military aspect if i may respond,Claim
we are proud of the record of accomplishment and the opportunities and the hope for millions of americans,Claim
i dont believe that we are going to turn the department of defense into a police organization,Claim
we have changed since 1980,Claim
weve got interest rates down weve got inflation down people are working again america is held in respect once again around the world,Claim
the governor of massachusetts has run up more debt than all the governors in the history of massachusetts combined going back to the days of the pilgrims,Premise
as we made those positive changes of lower interest rates lower rate of inflation the governor of massachusetts fought us every step of the way,Claim
hope and opportunity of these americans is because of the policies that we have had for the last eight years and we want to build on that and change it for even the better,Claim
as a matter of fact we are using the department of defense in a coordinated effort in reconnaissance,Claim
the military aspect of the drug problem is being addressed,Claim
weve made some success in this area,Claim
we are using our military assets in a prudent way to deal with interdiction,Claim
seventy tons of cocaine have been stopped,Claim
you cannot have a war on drugs,Claim
you cannot be tough on drugs and weak on crime,Claim
we believe people convicted of that crime deserve the death penalty as does the legislation thats in the congress that is supported by a bipartisan including many democrats of his party,Claim
when you look at the drug problem its a complicated problem,Claim
it is a tremendous problem,Claim
there are no easy solutions to it,Claim
its heading up the effort to try to create a drugfree america which is a challenge and a goal of all of us,Claim
not only will we utilize national defense and the department of defense but weve got to get on the demand side of the ledger,Claim
weve got to get to education,Claim
it ought to be reinforced in our schools,Claim
education ought to begin at home,Claim
we need to focus on another part of this problem and that problem is law enforcement,Claim
we will use military assets,Claim
he is opposed to the death penalty for drug kingpins,Premise
here is where we have a major disagreement with the governor of massachusetts,Claim
thats a positive attack against drugs,Claim
we would be doing that around the rest of the country,Claim
its also interesting to see that one of his campaign managers thats trying to help him with his image was also hired by noriega to help him with his image in panama,Claim
theres another thing that will be more important than the premise of this question on a hypothetical of using troops,Claim
its interesting to see that the senator from indiana when we had a resolution on the floor of the united states senate sponsored by senator dole that this government would make no deal with noriega  that the senator from indiana was one of the dozen senators that voted against it,Claim
we have seen them using eight cabinet officers twentyeight different agencies all fighting over turf  and that is one thing we would correct under a dukakisbentsen administration,Claim
we would put one person in charge in the war against drugs,Claim
we would commit the resources to get that job done,Claim
mike dukakis has been able to do that type of thing in the state of massachusetts by cutting the drug use in the high schools while its going up around the rest of the country by putting in a drug educational program that the drug enforcement agency said was a model to the country,Claim
i dont believe that its proper for me to get into the specifics of a hypothetical situation like that,Claim
if that situation arises yes i will be prepared and i will be prepared to lead this country if that happens,Claim
i know what it takes to lead this country forward,Claim
i know them they know me,Claim
i have traveled a number of times,Premise
ive been to geneva many times to meet with our negotiators as we were hammering out the inf treaty,Premise
ive met with the western political leaders  margaret thatcher chancellor kohl,Premise
ive tried to list the qualifications of twelve years in the united states congress,Premise
i have served in the congress for twelve years,Premise
i have served in the congress and served eight years on the senate armed services committee,Premise
i think what we are looking at here is someone that can step in at the presidency level at the moment if that tragedy would occur,Claim
i hope that would mean that you would say we are going to vote for mike dukakis and lloyd bentsen,Claim
if you do that type of thing then you arrive at a judgment that i think would be a wise one,Claim
you have to see what kind of leadership roles that person has played in his life before that crisis struck him,Claim
if thats the case again you have to look at maturity of judgment and you have to look at breadth of experience,Claim
i really must say brit i dont make many mistakes but that one was a real doozy,Claim
i agree with that,Claim
i immediately disbanded it,Claim
it was perfectly legal,Claim
i still believe that the better way to go is to have a campaign reform law that takes care of that kind of a situation,Claim
even though its legal the perception is bad,Claim
i would push very strong to see that we reform the entire situation,Claim
id work for that end,Claim
thats what my friend from indiana has opposed repeatedly vote after vote,Claim
that way we wont have to worry about breakfast clubs or whos the number one pac raiser,Claim
we can go back and get the contributions from the working men and women and the individuals of america,Claim
theres legislation before the congress to do that,Claim
lets eliminate political action committees the special interest money,Claim
we can also strengthen our two party system and rely more on the political parties than we have in the past,Claim
no one knows,Claim
it needs strengthening,Claim
thats the kind of campaign reform that im for,Claim
i hope the senator will join me,Claim
most scientists think that something were doing human beings are doing are exacerbating this problem and that this could in a couple of generations threaten our descendants comfort and health and perhaps even their existence,Premise
i think what you can do in that one and which would be very helpful is to use a lot more natural gas which burns a lot cleaner,Claim
we must be committed to trying  to clean up the water clean up the air and do everything we can not only from a research standpoint but also in the applied legislation to see that thats carried out,Claim
if we dont protect that well destroy the future of our children,Claim
ill do those things that are necessary to put the environment of our country number one,Claim
we can convert corn to ethanol and i would push for that very strong,Claim
absolutely,Claim
we can use other things thatll help the farmer,Claim
ive supported that very strongly,Claim
we have to look for alternative sources of fuel,Claim
the department of energy is one that has cut back substantially on the study of those alternative sources of fuels,Premise
the greenhouse effect is one that has to be a threat to all of us,Claim
i dont think that thats a proper objective in trying to clean up this environment,Claim
its interesting to me to see in the resume of senator quayle that he brags on the fact that hes been able to fight the acid rain legislation,Claim
we need to get on with it,Claim
that legislation wont get through the congress this year,Claim
he has said further that he will deal with the acid rain legislation and reduce millions of tons of the s02 content,Premise
it will get through in a george bush administration,Claim
a george bush administration that is committed to the environment,Claim
the greenhouse effect is an important environmental issue,Claim
it is important for us to get the data in to see what alternatives we might have to the fossil fuels and make sure we know what were doing,Claim
in a george bush administration you can bet that we will,Claim
the drought highlighted the problem that we have,Premise
there are some explorations and things that we can consider in this area,Claim
i would rather have people come over here and to make investments in this country rather than going elsewhere,Claim
by coming over here and making investments in this country we are seeing jobs,Premise
do you realize that today we are producing hondas and exporting hondas to japan,Claim
we are the envy of the world,Claim
i ts not just with the japanese,Claim
when you look at dealing with this total problem you have got to see why are we a debtor and what is attracting the foreign investment into our country today whether its japanese or others,Claim
they laugh at that,Claim
they dont believe that the united states of america is the envy of the world,Premise
the american people think the united states of america is the envy of the world,Claim
some of senator bentsens supporters laugh at that,Claim
we are the greatest nation in this world and the greatest economic power,Claim
forgiveness of debt is wrong,Claim
forgiveness of international debt would be counterproductive,Claim
i would like to see those that talk about forgiving debt,Claim
thats not the kind of policy george bush will have,Claim
senator bentsen go out and talk about a farmer thats in debt that doesnt have his forgiven,Premise
what we also should do is get them to give us more burden sharing when it comes to national defense,Claim
we have a situation today where on a per capita basis people in western europe are spending about onethird as much as we are in our country,Claim
i dont understand that,Claim
the senator from indiana when we passed a resolution in the united states senate to ask for burden sharing on that cost to keep those sea lanes open from the japanese he votes against that,Premise
then when you go to japan where were spending 612 percent on defense of the democracies theyre spending one percent,Premise
i would make sure that the people in the cabinet and the people that are advisors to the president are called in and i would talk to them,Premise
i will work with them,Claim
i will know them on a firsthand basis,Claim
i will know them on a firsthand basis,Claim
as vice president i will sit on the national security council,Claim
im going to be coordinating the drug effort,Claim
i will know them on a firsthand basis,Claim
i will have daytoday activities with all the people in government,Claim
i will be prepared to do that,Claim
vice president george bush is going to recreate the space council,Premise
i will be in charge of that,Claim
i will be prepared not only because of my service in the congress but because of my ability to communicate and to lead,Claim
it is not just age its accomplishments its experience,Claim
i have far more experience than many others that sought the office of vice president of this country,Claim
i will be prepared to deal with the people in the bush administration if that unfortunate event would ever occur,Claim
i have as much experience in the congress as jack kennedy did when he sought the presidency,Claim
i will be prepared to carry out the responsibilities of the presidency of the united states of america,Claim
if that unfortunate situation happens which would be very tragic,Premise
i knew jack kennedy,Claim
jack kennedy was a friend of mine,Premise
senator i served with jack kennedy,Premise
senator you are no jack kennedy,Claim
im one who knew him well,Claim
you are the one that was making the comparison senator,Claim
i think you are so far apart in the objectives you choose for your country that i did not think the comparison was welltaken,Claim
tom thats one of the toughest problems that any chief executive will face,Claim
you cant help but have sympathy for that family and for those hostages in the cells,Premise
you cant trade arms for hostages,Claim
the one thing we ought to know by now is that you cant go out and make secret deals with the ayatollah,Claim
thats been the result by this dumb idea that was cooked up in the white house basement,Claim
when you try to do that there is no question but what you just encourage more taking of hostages,Premise
i would speak up on that type of thing,Claim
not to encourage more taking of hostages,Claim
thats what you would strive to do to have a successful release finally of those hostages,Claim
if lloyd bentsen was in those meetings you would certainly hear from him and no one would be asking where is lloyd,Claim
i would be saying thats a dumb idea,Premise
i want to tell you that george bush attending seventeen of those meetings and having no record of what he said,Claim
theres no doubt about it that arms for hostages is wrong,Claim
it will never be repeated,Claim
we learn by our mistakes,Premise
there have been a number of successes in foreign policy in this administration,Claim
we will keep trying,Claim
they can do that starting now by releasing those hostages that are held illegally,Claim
well keep the doors open,Claim
hopefully some day iran and others who control those hostages will want to return to civilized international community,Claim
i think what you have to look at is the record of a man who has served his country in war headed up a squadron in combat a man who built a business knew what it was to meet a payroll and create jobs and then serve in the united states senate,Claim
i must say i didnt do a very good job of running for the presidency and im well aware of that,Claim
what we are looking at today is trying to judge once again the breadth of experience and the maturity of someone taking on this kind of a task,Claim
that is the judgment that has to be exercised by the people of america,Claim
you cant have a more important responsibility than that one,Claim
its a presidential decision that you are facing and a very important one,Claim
we are talking about who is going to lead this country into its future,Premise
that is an accomplishment that i will take with me into the white house,Claim
that is an accomplishment,Claim
what we have been able to do is establish a program that is working that is putting people back to work,Claim
one of the accomplishments im proudest of is the authorship of the job training partnership act that has trained and educated and employed over three million young people and adults that are economically disadvantaged,Claim
when you look at qualifications you look at accomplishments as well as experience,Claim
we did it in a way that we got the private sector to involve itself with the public sector on private industry councils throughout america that serve over the service delivery areas,Claim
we have 51 percent of that private industry council that are businessmen and women,Claim
we have members of unions,Claim
we have communitybased organizations,Claim
we have education leaders,Claim
those three books which i read over the last spring vacation and early summer had a very definite impact,Claim
what former president nixon and senator richard lugar were talking about was a foreign policy as we move toward the 21st century,Premise
the three books are one richard nixons victory in 1999 richard lugars  senator richard lugars  letters to the next president bob masseys nicholas and alexandra which deals with the fall of the russian empire and the coming of leninism in 1917,Premise
a george bush administration will pursue that policy,Claim
i understand it,Claim
the governor of massachusetts doesnt understand that,Claim
this is one of the differences between george bush and michael dukakis,Claim
former president nixon talked about what we are going to do after detente and arms control and how we are going to pursue new arms control with the soviet union,Premise
he talked a little bit about how we deal with the soviet union,Premise
george bush understands that to deal with the soviet union and to get progress you must deal from a position of strength,Premise
the historical book of the downfall of the czar and the coming of leninism combining those three books together gave me a better appreciation of the challenges that we have ahead of us,Claim
in senator lugars book he talks about the advancement of human rights around the world,Premise
he talked about his leadership effort in the philippines and south africa where we now see human rights advancement on the reagan agenda,Premise
reading winds of war and guns of august back to back  i think that really shows you how we make the same mistakes too often over and over again,Claim
it seems to me that the senator from indiana is beginning to do that one,Claim
i think he deserves great credit with that one,Claim
as i look toward our progress thats been made toward disarmament and cutting back on nuclear weapons and see what ronald reagan has been able to do with the inf treaty,Premise
i think thats a mistake,Claim
i see a situation where the senator from indiana has now jumped off the reservation,Claim
when we talk about building on what ronald reagan has done and opposes what ronald reagan wants to do the joint chiefs of staff and the secretary of defense and says lets go slow on further disarmament in trying to get the next treaty,Premise
i think that you have to deal with the russians from strength,Claim
we have to understand that you have to have a strong modernized nuclear deterrent,Claim
i think we can make substantial progress and we ought to take advantage,Claim
i think hes arrived at a very dangerous judgment in the question of war and peace and it concerns me very much,Claim
i saw him also try to sabotage the inf treaty when it was on the floor of the united states senate with what he was doing there,Premise
hes listening once again to the winds of the radical right,Premise
somehow i havent been straightforward,Claim
i have,Claim
im proud to have been the author of that,Claim
you know what we had we had a ceta program that spent 50 billion from about 1973 through 1982 when we concluded that program unemployment was higher than when it began,Premise
it was a program that didnt work,Claim
the job training partnership act does work,Claim

i try to turn the situation around where we have seen the subsidy payments go from two and a half billion to ten times that under this administration,Claim
the way i would accomplish thatwas with a tough trade policy opening up those markets getting those prices back up to market prices,Claim
that means we have to stand up for the american farmers and that cuts back on the regulation on american farmers,Claim
thats a positive way to accomplish that,Claim
we can do that if we have an aggressive trade policy for our country if we make trade a number one priority and not trade it off for some foreign policy objective at the moment,Claim
we do some of the things that i think have to be done insofar as doing a better job of procurement,Claim
particularly when were talking about some of our military things that we should buy,Premise

when congress goes ahead and puts into appropriations bills unrequested and unnecessary spending let the president put a line through that send it back to the congress,Claim
i think its part of the strength and the character of this land that he reaches out and that he wants someone that will speak up,Claim

michael dukakis wasnt looking for a clone,Claim
those are positive plus things and major issues facing our nation,Claim

hes taken it down some four percent in the high schools of that state,Claim
while its gone up about the rest of the nation,Premise
you would seem him as president of the united states being very aggressive in this fight against crime and having that kind of a successful result,Claim
thats one of the reasons im delighted and proud to be on the ticket with him,Claim
in the state of massachusetts he has the homicide rate down to the lowest of any industrial state,Claim
its substantially ahead of the national average,Premise

what ive seen in the way of poverty down there in that area and the lack of medical attention and trying to see that thats turned around,Premise
you will have a choice to make on election day,Claim
you will have a choice of whether america is going to choose the road of michael dukakis or the road of george bush as we march toward the 21st century,Claim
the road of michael dukakis comes down to this bigger government higher taxes,Claim

whats in the best interests of our people,Premise
is it in our nations interests,Premise
ive thought a lot about what it means to be the president,Claim
ive thought long and hard about the honor of being the president of the united states,Claim
peace in the middle east is in our nations interests,Claim
having a hemisphere that is free for trade and peaceful is in our nations interests,Claim
strong relations in europe is in our nations interest,Claim
i also understand that an administration is not one person,Claim
an administration is dedicated citizens who are called by the president to serve the country to serve a cause greater than self,Premise
ive thought about an administration of people who represent all america but people who understand my compassionate and conservative philosophy,Premise
i havent started naming names except for one person and thats mr richard cheney who i thought did a great job the other night,Premise
i think people got to see why i picked him,Claim
hes man of solid judgment,Premise
hes going to be a person to stand by my side,Premise
one of the things ive done in texas is ive been able to put together a good team of people,Premise
ive been able to set clear goals,Premise
the goals ought to be an education system that leaves no child behind medicare for our seniors a social security system thats safe and secure foreign policy thats in our nations interest and a strong military and then bring people together to achieve those goals,Claim
i dont think thats just the kind of exaggeration that we take pride in as americans,Claim
its really true even the ones that sometimes shake their fists at us,Premise
as soon as they have a change that allows the people to speak freely theyre wanting to develop some kind of blueprint that will help them be like us more freedom free markets political freedom,Premise
i think first and foremost our power ought to be wielded to in ways that form a more perfect union,Claim
weve got to enforce our civil rights laws,Claim
the power of example is americas greatest power in the world,Claim
that means for example standing up for human rights,Premise
it means addressing the problems of injustice and inequity along the lines of race and ethnicity here at home,Claim
in all these other places around the world where theyre having these terrible problems when they feel hope it is often because they see in us a reflection of their potential,Premise
weve got to deal with things like racial profiling,Claim
we have to keep our military strong,Claim
we have the strongest military,Premise
ill do whatever is necessary if im president to make sure that it stays that way,Claim
our real power comes i think from our values,Claim
i see our greatest national strength coming from what we stand for in the world,Claim
i see it as a question of values,Claim
it is a great tribute to our founders that 224 years later this nation is now looked to by the peoples on every other continent and the peoples from every part of this earth as a kind of model for what their future could be,Premise
i think they ought to look at us as a country that understands freedom where it doesnt matter who you are or how youre raised or where youre from that you can succeed,Claim
i dont think theyll look at us with envy,Claim
it really depends upon how our nation conducts itself in foreign policy,Claim
theyll resent us,Claim

theyll welcome us,Claim
if were a humble nation but strong,Premise
we have to be humble,Claim
our nation stands alone right now in the world in terms of power,Premise
and yet project strength in a way that promotes freedom,Claim
i dont think they ought to look at us in any way other than what we are,Claim
were a freedomloving nation,Premise
if were an arrogant nation,Premise
theyll view us that way,Claim
if were a humble nation,Premise
theyll respect us,Claim
i agree with that,Claim
i agree with that,Claim
i think that the idea of humility is an important one,Claim
i think that we also have to have a sense of mission in the world,Claim
one of the problems that we have faced in the world is that we are so much more powerful than any single nation has been in relationship to the rest of the world than at any time in history that i know about anyway that there is some resentment of us power,Premise
we have to protect our capacity to push forward what americas all about,Claim
not only military strength and our values it also means keeping our economy strong,Claim
in the last or two decades ago it was routine for leaders of foreign countries to come over here and say you guys have got to do something about these horrendous deficits because its causing tremendous problems for the rest of the world,Premise
we were lectured to all the time,Premise
we need to do more,Claim
the fact that we have the strongest economy in history today is not good enough,Claim
the fact that it is so strong enables us to project the power for good that america can represent,Premise
yes it does,Claim
take for example third world debt,Premise
i think we ought to be forgiving third world debt under certain conditions,Claim
for example if were convinced that a third world country thats got a lot of debt would reform itself,Premise
that the money wouldnt go into the hands of a few but would go to help people,Premise
i think it makes sense for us to use our wealth in that way or to trade debt for valuable rain forest lands makes that much sense yes,Claim
we can lend money but we have to do it wisely,Claim
we shouldnt be lending money to corrupt officials,Premise
we do have an obligation but we cant be all things to all people,Claim
we can help build coalitions,Premise
we cant put our troops all around the world,Premise
we got to be guarded in our generosity,Claim
the first priority has to be on ending the violence dampening down the tensions that have arisen there,Claim
we need to call upon syria to release the three israeli soldiers who have been captured,Claim
we need to insist that arafat send out instructions to halt some of the provocative acts of violence that have been going on,Claim
i think that we also have to keep a weather eye toward saddam hussein,Claim
he is taking advantage of this situation to once again make threats,Premise
he needs to understand that hes not only dealing with israel he is dealing  hes dealing with us if he is making the kind of threats that hes talking about there,Premise
our bonds with israel are larger than agreements or disagreements on some details of diplomatic initiatives,Claim
they are historic,Premise
they are strong,Premise
they are enduring,Premise
our ability to serve as an honest broker is something that we need to shepherd,Claim
our country has been very active with regular conversations with the leaders there,Premise
in the last 24 hours there has been some subsiding of the violence there,Premise
its a very tense situation there,Premise
i think during the campaign particularly now during this difficult period we ought to be speaking with one voice,Claim
i appreciate the way the administration has worked hard to calm the tensions,Premise
i think credibility is going to be very important in the future in the middle east,Claim
should i be the president israels going to be our friend,Claim
im going to stand by israel,Claim
i call on chairman arafat to have his people pull back to make the peace,Premise
i think its important to reach out to moderate arab nations like jordan and egypt saudi arabia and kuwait,Claim
its important to be friends with people when you dont need each other so that when you do theres a strong bond of friendship,Premise
the coalition against saddam has fallen apart or its unraveling,Claim
the sanctions are being violated,Premise
we dont know whether hes developing weapons of mass destruction,Premise
theres going to be a consequence should i be the president,Claim
he better not be,Premise
thats going to be particularly important in dealing not only with situations such as now occurring in israel but with saddam hussein,Claim
its important to have credibility,Claim
credibility is formed by being strong with your friends and resolute in your determination,Claim
i think its important for this nation to develop an antiballistic missile system that we can share with our allies in the middle east,Claim
if need be to keep the peace,Premise
to be able to say to the saddam husseinâ€™s of the world or the iranians dont dare threaten our friends,Premise
its also important to keep strong ties in the middle east credible ties,Claim
because of the energy crisis were now in,Premise
a lot of the energy is produced from the middle east,Premise
we stand with israel,Claim
we have maintained the ability to serve as an honest broker,Premise
thats important,Claim
israel cannot have direct dialogue with some of the people on the other side of conflicts especially during times of tension unless that dialogue comes through us,Premise
we will have thrown away a strategic asset thats important not only to us but also to israel,Claim
if we throw away that ability to serve as an honest broker,Premise
i do,Claim
it cant be the united states timetable as to how discussions take place,Claim
its got to be a timetable that all parties can agree to like the palestinians and israelis,Premise
the term honest broker makes sense,Claim
any lasting peace is going to have to be a peace thats good for both sides,Premise
i will try to do the same thing,Claim
this current administrations worked hard to keep the parties at the table,Premise
it wont be on my timetable,Claim
it will be on the timetable that people are comfortable with in the middle east,Claim

the coalition that was in place isnt as strong as it used to be,Premise
he is a danger,Premise
we dont want him fishing in troubled waters in the middle east,Premise
its going to be hard its going to be important to rebuild that coalition to keep the pressure on him,Claim
i want to go further,Claim
thats the situation that was left when i got there,Claim
when i got to be a part of the current administration it was right after  i was one of the few members of my political party to support former president bush in the persian gulf war resolution,Premise
at the end of that war for whatever reason it was not finished in a way that removed saddam hussein from power,Premise
i want to give robust support to the groups that are trying to overthrow saddam hussein,Claim
there are allegations that theyre too weak to do it,Premise
but thats what they said about the forces that were opposing milosevic in serbia,Premise
the policy of enforcing sanctions against serbia has just resulted in a spectacular victory for democracy just in the past week,Premise
it seems to me that having taken so long to see the sanctions work there building upon the policy of containment that was successful over a much longer period of time against the former soviet union in the communist block,Premise
seems a little early to declare that we should give up on the sanctions,Claim
all of these flights that have come in all of them have been in accordance with the sanctions regime im told except for three where they notified,Premise
they want to base their vote on differences between the two of you as president how you would handle middle east policy,Claim
people watching here tonight are very interested in middle east policy,Premise
i dont think they should be allowed to,Claim
theyre trying to break out of the box,Premise
no of course not,Claim
absolutely not,Claim
i want them to be tougher,Claim
i think its a triumph,Claim
i think its good public policy,Claim
it worked,Premise
im pleased i took  made the decision i made,Claim
im pleased the president made the decision he made,Claim
freedom took hold in that part of the world,Premise
i called upon the congress not to hamstring the administration,Premise
in terms of forcing troop withdrawals on a timetable that wasnt necessarily in our best interest or fit our nations strategy,Premise
theres a lot of work left to be done,Claim
i thought the president made the right decision in joining nato and bombing serbia,Claim
i supported them when they did so,Claim
yes i think it is,Claim
absolutely,Claim
i dont think he would have fallen had we not used the force,Claim
i thought he made the right decision to do so,Claim
i didnt think he necessarily made the right decision to take land troops off the table right before we committed ourselves offensively,Claim
nevertheless it worked,Premise
the administration deserves credit for having made it work,Claim
it is important for nato to have it work,Premise
its important for nato to be strong and confident and to help keep the peace in europe,Premise
i felt so strongly that the united states needed to participate,Claim
because of our relations with nato,Premise
nato is going to be an important part of keeping the peace in the future,Premise
theres more work to do,Claim
i certainly hope there is one,Claim
remains to be seen however whether or not theres going to be a political settlement in kosovo,Premise
i hope our european friends become the peacekeepers in bosnia and in the balkans,Claim
i hope that they put the troops on the ground,Claim
so that we can withdraw our troops and focus our military on fighting and winning war,Premise
ive been kind of a hardliner on this issue for more than eight years,Claim
when i was in the senate before i became vice president i was pushing for stronger action against milosevic,Premise
he caused the death of so many people,Premise
he was the last communist party boss there,Premise
then he became a dictator that by some other label he was still essentially a communist dictator,Premise
unfortunately now he is trying to reassert himself in serbian politics,Claim
just today the members of his political party said that they were going to ignore the orders of the new president of serbia,Premise
that they question his legitimacy,Premise
hes still going to try to be actively involved,Premise
he should be held accountable,Claim
he is an indicted war criminal,Premise
by itself that to me can bring into play a fundamental american strategic interest,Claim
its based on our values,Premise
in some of the discussions weve had about when its appropriate for the us to use force around the world at times the standards that youve laid down have given me the impression that if its something like a genocide taking place or what they called ethnic cleansing in bosnia that that alone would not be that that wouldnt be the kind of situation that would cause you to think that the us ought to get involved with troops,Premise
ill commit troops,Claim
if i think its in our nations strategic interest,Premise
i thought it was in our strategic interests to keep milosevic in check,Claim
because of our relations in nato,Premise
i think its important for nato to be strong and confident,Claim
i felt like unchecked milosevic would harm nato,Premise
i thought that was a mistake,Claim
i think that that was illconsidered,Claim
i think in retrospect the lessons there are ones that we should take very very seriously,Claim
i did support it at the time,Premise
i supported that,Claim
i supported that,Claim
supported it,Claim
i voted for it,Premise
yes,Claim
yes,Claim
yes,Claim
thats where the mission went wrong,Claim
started off as a humanitarian mission and it changed into a nationbuilding mission,Premise
the mission was changed,Premise
as a result our nation paid a price,Claim
i dont think our troops ought to be used for whats called nationbuilding,Claim
i think our troops ought to be used to fight and win war,Claim
i think our troops ought to be used to help overthrow the dictator when its in our best interests,Claim
in this case it was a nationbuilding exercise,Premise
same with haiti,Premise
i wouldnt have supported either,Claim
yes,Claim
yes,Claim
yes,Claim
i think the administration did the right thing in that case,Claim
i do,Claim
some of them ive got a conflict of interest on,Claim
the persian gulf,Premise
bosnia,Premise
you have already talked about kosovo,Premise
i thought they made the right decision not to send us troops into rwanda,Claim
the administration made the right decision on training nigerian troops for situations just such as this in rwanda,Claim
it was a horrible situation,Premise
no one liked to see it on our tv screens,Premise
we need to use our influence to have countries in africa come together and help deal with the situation,Claim
its a case where we need to make sure we have an early warning system in place in places where there could be ethnic cleansing and genocide the way we saw it there in rwanda,Premise
i think in retrospect we were too late getting in there,Claim
we could have saved more lives if we had acted earlier,Premise
i do not think that it was an example of a conflict where we should have put our troops in to try to separate the parties for this reason,Claim
we did actually send troops into rwanda to help with the humanitarian relief measures,Premise
my wife tipper who is here actually went on a military plane with general sholicatchvieli on one of those flights,Premise
one of the criteria that i think is important in deciding when and if we should ever get involved around the world is whether or not our national security interest is involved if we can really make the difference with military forces if we tried everything else if we have allies,Claim
in the balkans we have allies nato ready willing and able to go and carry a big part of the burden,Premise
in africa we did not,Premise
i think it was the right thing not to jump in as heartbreaking as it was,Claim
i think we should have come in much quicker with the humanitarian mission,Claim
we had no allies,Premise
it was very unclear that we could actually accomplish what we would want to accomplish about putting military forces there,Premise
our country has tried to create an africa crisis response team there and weve met some resistance,Premise
we have had some luck with nigeria but in sierra leon and now that nigeria has become a democracy and we hope it stays that way then maybe we can build on that,Premise
weve got to do a lot of work in africa to promote democracy and trade,Claim
vice president mentioned nigeria is a fledgling democracy,Premise
we have to work with nigeria,Claim
itâ€™s an important continent,Claim
theres got to be priorities,Premise
middle east is a priority,Claim
as is europe and the far east,Claim
our own hemisphere,Premise
for a lot of reasons,Premise
those are my four top priorities should i be the president,Claim
i thought that was a good model,Claim
i wouldnt have sent troops to haiti,Claim
i didnt think it was a mission worthwhile,Claim
it was a nation building mission,Premise
it was not very successful,Premise
it cost us billions a couple billions of dollars,Premise
im not so sure democracy is any better off in haiti than it was before,Premise
not to say we wont be engaged nor work hard to get other nations to come together to prevent atrocity,Claim
i thought the best example of a way to handle the situation was east timor when we provided logistical support to the australians support that only we can provide,Premise
we cant be all things to all people in the world,Premise
i think thats where maybe the vice president and i begin to have some differences,Claim
i want to be judicious in its use,Claim
im worried about overcommitting our military around the world,Premise
i dont think we agree on that,Claim
i think we have to be very reticent about that,Claim
i would certainly also be judicious in evaluating any potential use of american troops overseas,Claim
the united states is now the natural leader of the world,Claim
the world is changing so rapidly,Premise
the world is getting much closer together,Premise
all these other countries are looking to us,Premise
just because we cannot be involved everywhere and shouldnt be doesnt mean that we should shy away from going in anywhere,Claim
i think there is a difference here,Claim
during the years between world war i and world war ii a great lesson was learned by our military leaders and the people of the united states,Claim
we were nation building,Claim
this idea of nation building is kind of a pejorative phrase,Premise
the lesson was that in the aftermath of world war i we kind of turned our backs and left them to their own devices and they brewed up a lot of trouble that quickly became world war ii,Premise
acting upon that lesson in the aftermath of our great victory in world war ii we laid down the marshall plan president truman did,Premise
we got intimately involved in building nato and other structures there,Premise
we still have lots of troops in europe,Premise
it was economic,Premise
it was also military,Premise
the confidence that those countries recovering from the wounds of war had by having troops there,Premise
we had civil administrators come in to set up their ways of building their towns back,Premise
i think one of the lessons in between world war i and world war ii is we let our military atrophy,Claim
we cant do that,Claim
weve got to rebuild our military,Claim
one of the problems we have in the military is were in a lot of places around the world,Claim
i mentioned one and thats the balkans,Premise
i would very much like to get our troops out of there,Premise
we cant do it now,Claim
that would be an abrogation of our agreement with nato,Premise
i think it ought to be one of our priorities to work with our european friends to convince them to put troops on the ground,Claim
there is an example,Premise
haiti is another example,Premise
i think its important for us to be training columbians in that part of the world,Claim
the hemisphere is in our interest to have a peaceful columbia,Premise
i dont think so,Claim
i think what we need to do is convince people who live in the lands they live in to build the nations,Claim
absolutely not,Claim
when it gets overextended morale drops,Claim
our military is meant to fight and win war,Premise
thats what its meant to do,Premise
i strongly believe we need to have a military presence in the korean peninsula,Claim
not only to keep the peace in the peninsula but to keep regional stability,Premise
i strongly believe we need to keep a presence in nato,Claim
im going to be judicious as to how to use the military,Premise
it needs to be in our vital interest,Claim
the mission needs to be clear,Claim
the extra strategy obvious,Claim
i dont disagree with that,Claim
we ought to get our troops home from places like the balkans as soon as we can as soon as the mission is complete,Claim
thats what we did in haiti,Premise
there are no more than a handful of american military personnel in haiti now,Premise
thats really about all we can do,Claim
haitians have their problems,Premise
we gave them a chance to restore democracy,Premise
i think that we did the right thing there,Claim
if you have a situation like that right in our backyard with chaos about to break out and flotillas forming to come across the water and all kinds of violence there right in one of our neighboring countries there,Premise
we cant allow ourselves to get overextended,Claim
i certainly agree with that,Claim
ive supported building up our capacity,Claim
ive devoted in the budget ive proposed as i said last week more than twice as much as the governor has proposed,Premise
i think that its in better shape now than he generally does,Claim
i believe we ought to have foreign aid,Claim
i dont think we ought to just have foreign aid for the sake of foreign aid,Claim
we have to continue building up readiness and military strength,Claim
we have to also be very cautious in the way we use our military,Claim
thats a place where we can use our generosity to influence in a positive way influence nations,Premise
i think foreign aid needs to be used to encourage markets and reform,Claim
i think a lot of times we just spend aid and say we feel better about it and it ends up being spent the wrong way,Claim
theres some pretty egregious examples recently,Premise
one being russia where we had imf loans that ended up in the pockets of a lot of powerful people and didnt help the nation,Premise
it needs to be available for emergency situations,Claim
i think the imf has got a role in the world,Claim
i dont want to see the imf out there as a way to say to world bankers if you make a bad loan well bail you out,Premise
i thought the president did the right thing with mexico and was very strongly supportive of the administration in mexico,Claim
i dont think the imf ought to be a stop loss for people who ought to be able to evaluate risks themselves,Claim
ill look at every place where were investing money,Claim
i just want to make sure the return is good,Premise
no,Claim
i would make some changes,Claim
i think there need to be reforms in the imf,Claim
ive generally supported it but ive seen them make some calls that i thought were highly questionable,Premise
theres a general agreement in many parts of the world now that there ought to be changes in the imf,Premise
the world bank i think is generally doing a better job,Claim
i think one of the big issues here that doesnt get nearly enough attention is the issue of corruption,Claim
ive worked on this issue,Premise
the governor mentioned it earlier,Premise
corruption in official agencies like militaries and police departments around the world customs officials thats one of the worst forms of it,Premise
its an enormous problem,Premise
i just think jim that this is an absolutely unique period in world history,Claim
theyre looking to us,Premise
the worldâ€™s coming together,Premise
we have got to again lead by example,Claim

to step up to the plate,Claim
to provide the leadership on the environment leadership to make sure the world economy keeps moving in the right direction,Claim
that means not running big deficits here and not squandering our surplus,Claim
so that we can provide that leadership role,Premise
it means having intelligent decisions that keep our prosperity going and shepherds that economic strength,Claim
im not so sure the role of the united states is to go around the world and say this is the way its got to be,Claim
we can help,Claim
i want to empower the people,Claim
maybe its just our difference in government the way we view government,Premise

we went into russia we said here is some imf money and it ended up in viktor chemomyrdins pocket and others and yet we played like there was reform,Premise
the only people that are going to reform russia are russia,Premise
theyre going to have to make the decision themselves,Claim
mr putin is going to have to make the decision as to whether or not he wants to adhere to rule of law and normal accounting practices so that if countries andor entities invest capital theres a reasonable rate of return a way to get the money out of the economy,Premise
russia has to make the decision,Claim

there needs to be a consequence at the federal level,Claim
its very important that we not overstep our bounds,Claim
most police officers are good dedicated honorable citizens who are doing their job putting their lives at risk who arent bigoted or arent prejudiced,Premise

curriculum that works and phonics needs to be an integral part of our reading curriculum,Premise
intensive reading laboratories teacher retraining,Premise
there needs to be a wholesale effort against racial profiling which is illiterate children,Claim
we can do better in our public schools,Claim
we can close an achievement gap,Claim
it starts with making sure we have strong accountability,Claim
one of the cornerstones of reform and good reform is to measure,Claim
when you measure you can ask the question do they know is anybody being profiled is anybody being discriminated against,Premise
it becomes a tool a corrective tool,Premise
i believe the federal government must say that if you receive any money you must show us whether or not the children are learning,Claim
any money from the federal government for disadvantaged children for example,Premise
if they are fine,Claim
if theyre not there has to be a consequence,Claim

the law that was proposed in texas that had the support of the byrd family and a whole lot of people in texas did in fact die in committee,Premise
its important,Claim
not just because of texas but because this mirrors the national controversy,Premise
there may be some other statute that was already on the books but certainly the advocates of the hate crimes law felt that a tough new law was needed,Premise

i think thats a private matter,Claim
i think thats the way it ought to be,Claim

i support equal rights but not special rights for people,Claim
im going to be respectful for people,Claim

i hope that we can come back to the subject of education,Claim
the governor made an extensive statement on it and i have a very different view than the one he expressed,Premise
i will not do anything to affect the rights of hunters or sportsmen,Claim
i think that homeowners have to be respected and their right to have a gun if they wish to,Claim
i think these assault weapons are a problem,Claim
the problem i see is that there are too many guns getting into the hands of children and criminals,Premise
people who for whatever reason some kind of history of stalking or domestic abuse really should not be able to get guns,Claim
i think we ought to restore the threeday waiting period under the brady law,Claim
i think we should toughen the enforcement of gun laws,Claim
so that the ones that are already on the books can be enforced much more effectively,Premise

have a gunfree zone around every school in this country,Claim
i think that measures like these are important,Claim
child safety trigger locks on a mandatory basis and others,Claim
i favor closing the gun show loophole,Claim
i cast the tiebreaking vote to close it but then the majority in the house of representatives went the other way,Premise
thats still pending,Premise
if we could get agreement on that maybe they could pass that in the final days of this congress,Premise
it starts with enforcing law,Claim
when you say loud and clear to somebody if youre going to carry a gun illegally were going to arrest you,Premise
the local law enforcement officials need help at the federal level,Claim
programs like project exile where the federal government intensifies arresting people who illegally use guns,Premise
if youre going to sell a gun illegally you need to be arrested,Premise
if you commit a crime with a gun there needs to be absolute certainty in the law,Premise
we havent done a very good job of that at the federal level recently,Premise
im going to make it a priority,Claim
i dont think we ought to be selling guns to people who shouldnt have them,Claim
i support instant background checks at gun shows,Claim
one of the reasons we have an instant background check is so that we instantly know whether or not somebody should have a gun or not,Premise
in texas i tried to do something innovative,Premise
theres a lot of talk about trigger locks being on guns sold in the future,Premise
i support that,Claim
i said if you want a trigger lock to make your gun safe come and get one for free,Premise
so were distributing in our state of texas for free,Premise
i think we ought to raise the age at which a juvenile can carry a handgun from 18 to 21,Claim

the criminal is not going to show up and say hey give me my id card,Premise
its the lawabiding citizens who will do that,Premise

i am for licensing by states of new handgun purchases,Claim
a photo license id like a drivers license for new handguns,Premise
i think states should do that for new handguns,Claim
too many criminals are getting guns,Premise
there was a recent investigation of the number in texas who got  who were given concealed weapons permits in spite of the fact that they had records,Premise
the los angeles times spent a lot of ink going into that,Premise
i am not for doing anything that would affect hunters or sportsmen rifles shotguns existing handguns,Claim
i do think that sensible gun safety measures are warranted now,Claim
the woman who bought the guns for the two boys who did that killing at columbine said that if she had had to give her name and fill out a form there she would not have bought those guns,Premise
that conceivably could have prevented that tragedy,Claim
this is in the aftermath of columbine and paducah and all the places in our country where the nation has been shocked by these weapons in the hands of the wrong people,Premise
im not for photo licensing,Claim
everybody believes that,Claim
he says we ought to have gunfree schools,Premise
im sure every state in the union has got them,Premise
you cant carry a gun into a school,Premise
there ought to be a consequence when you do carry a gun into a school,Claim
weve got gun laws,Premise
its really a matter of culture,Claim
columbine spoke to a larger issue,Premise
its a culture that somewhere along the line weve begun to disrespect life,Claim
where a child can walk in and have their heart turned dark as a result of being on the internet and walk in and decide to take somebody elses life,Premise
gun laws are important,Claim
so is loving children and character education classes and faithbased programs being a part of afterschool programs,Claim
some desperate child needs to have somebody put their arm around them and say we love you,Premise
this is a society that  of ours thats got to do a better job of teaching children right from wrong,Claim
theres a larger law,Claim
we can enforce law,Premise
there seems to be a lot of preoccupation on  not certainly only in this debate but just in general on law,Premise
love your neighbor like you would like to be loved yourself,Premise
thats where our society must head,Claim
if were going to be a peaceful and prosperous society,Premise
i also believe in the golden rule,Claim
i agree with a lot of the other things that the governor has said,Premise
we do have a serious problem in our culture,Claim
if im elected president i will do something about that,Claim
tipper and i have worked on the problem of violence in entertainment aimed at children,Premise
shes worked on it longer than i have,Premise
i feel very strongly about that,Premise
i think we have to start with better parenting,Claim
i dont think that we can ignore the role played by guns,Claim
even though no state wants them there are guns in some schools,Premise
its so difficult for schools to control that,Claim
in recent years there has been a flood of cheap handguns that are so widely available that kids are finding ways to get ahold of them,Premise
we do need some common sense gun safety steps to stem this flood of guns that are getting into the wrong hands,Claim
if you look at the situation as it exists here in the united states compared to any other country in the world,Premise
there also needs to be strong enforcement of the law,Claim
were tough,Claim
we believe in tough love,Claim
we added beds,Premise
in my state we toughen up the juvenile justice laws,Premise
some kid who feels like  doesnt matter where the gun comes from it could be a cheap gun expensive gun,Claim
what matters is something in this persons head says there is not going to be a consequence,Claim
we say if you get caught carrying a gun youre automatically detained,Premise
thats what needs to happen,Claim
weve got laws,Premise
thats important,Claim
if laws need to be strengthened like instant background checks,Premise
ive got a plan to do something about that its to make health care affordable and available this way,Claim
for those what i think we need to do is to develop an investmenttype vehicle that would be an incentive for them to invest,Claim
theres some who should be buying health care who choose not to,Premise
some of the healthy folks healthy young kids say ill never get sick therefore i dont need health care right now,Premise
like medical savings accounts with rollover capacity,Premise
in other words you say to a youngster it will be in your financial interest to start saving for future illness,Premise
for the working folks that do want to have health care that cant afford it a couple of things we need to do,Claim
we need more community health centers,Claim
ive developed  put out money in my budget to expand community health centers all around the country,Claim
these are places where people can get primary care,Premise
and theyre good,Premise
theyre very important parts of the safety net of health care,Premise
you get a 2000 rebate from the government if youre a family of 30000 or less  it scales down as you get higher  that you can use to purchase health care in the private markets,Claim
it will be a huge down payment for a pretty darn good system,Premise
if you allow  also allow  convince states to  allow states to allow the mother to match some of the childrens health insurance money with it the pool purchasing power,Claim
allow business associations like the national federal of independent business or the chamber of commerce or the national restaurant association to write association plans across jurisdictional lines,Claim
to make health care more affordable,Premise
so that small businesses have got the capacity to have national pooling to drive the cost of insurance down,Premise
i think thats the very best way to go,Claim
it empowers people,Premise
it trusts people,Premise
its a practical way to encourage people to purchase health care insurance,Premise
its one of my top priorities jim to give every single child in the united states affordable health care within the next four years,Claim
im not for a governmentrun system,Claim
i would like to see eventually in this country some form of universal health care,Premise
im for shrinking the size of government,Claim
i want a smaller and smarter government,Claim
i have been in charge of this reinventing government streamlining project thats reduced the size of government by more than 300000 people in the last several years,Premise
the budget plan that ive put out according to the los angeles times again the way these things are typically measured as a percentage of the gdp will bring government spending down to the lowest level in 50 years,Premise
i think we should start by greatly expanding the socalled child health insurance or chip program to give health insurance to every single child in this country,Claim
its intolerable that we have so many millions of children without any health insurance,Premise
its one of my top priorities,Claim
i want to proceed carefully to cover more people,Claim
i know that we have some disagreements on this,Claim
there is a record here,Claim
texas ranks 49th out of the 50 states in health care  in children with health care,Premise
49th for women with health care,Premise
50th for families with health care,Premise
it is a priority for me,Claim
i think it ought to be a top priority,Claim
thats exactly what he and mrs clinton and them fought for in 1993 was a governmentrun health care system,Premise
it was fortunately stopped in its tracks,Premise
we care about our people in texas,Claim
we spent a lot of money to make sure people get health care in the state of texas,Claim
were doing a better job than they are at the national level for reducing uninsured,Premise
we spend 47 billion a year on the uninsured in the state of texas,Premise
our rate of uninsured the percentage of uninsured in texas has gone down while the percentage of uninsured in america has gone up,Premise
our chips program got a late start,Claim
our government meets only four months out of every two years,Premise
limited government can work in the second largest state in the union,Claim
congress passes the bill after our session in 1997 ended we passed an enabling legislation in 1999,Premise
weve signed up over 110000 children to the chips program,Premise
for comparable states our size were signing them up as fast as any other state,Premise
i speculate that the reason why he didnt answer your question directly as to whether my numbers were right the facts were right about texas ranking dead last in families with health insurance and 49th out of 50 for both children and women is because those facts are correct,Claim
as for why it happened im no expert on the texas procedures but what my friends there tell me is that the governor opposed a measure put forward by democrats in the legislature to expand the number of children that would be covered,Premise
instead directed the money toward a tax cut a significant part of which went to wealthy interests,Premise
he declared the need for a new tax cut for the oil companies in texas an emergency need,Premise
the money was taken away from the chip program,Claim
there is now a federal judges opinion about the current management of this program ordering the state of texas to do,Premise
there are 14 million children in texas who do not have health insurance,Premise
600000 of whom and maybe some of those have since gotten it but as of a year ago 600000 of them were actually eligible for it but they couldnt sign up for it because of the barriers that they had set up,Premise
if hes trying to allege that im a hardhearted person and i dont care about children hes absolutely wrong,Claim
weve spent 47 billion a year in the state of texas for uninsured people,Premise
they get health care,Premise
its not the most efficient way to get people health care,Claim
the number of uninsured in america during their watch has increased,Premise
were reducing the number of uninsured percentage of our population,Premise
as the percentage of the population is increasing nationally somehow the allegation that we dont care and were going to give money for this interest or that interest and not for children in the state of texas is totally absurd,Premise
im just telling you our state comes together to do what is right,Claim
we come together both republicans and democrats,Premise
people know im a conservative person and a compassionate person,Claim
i was able to do so with a lot of democrat votes nearly 50 of the hispanic vote about 27 of the africanamerican vote,Premise
theres only been one governor ever elected to backtoback fouryear terms and that was me,Premise
the people of texas,Premise
let me just tell you who the jury is,Premise
yes yes,Claim
its not a statement about his heart,Claim
i dont claim to know his heart,Premise
i think hes a good person,Claim
i make no allegations about that,Premise
i believe him when he says that he has a good heart,Claim
i think its about his priorities,Claim
i know enough about your story to admire a lot of the things that you have done as a person,Premise
its a question of priorities and values,Claim
if you were the governor of a state that was dead last in health care for families and all of a sudden you found yourself with the biggest surplus your state had ever had in its history wouldnt you want to maybe use some of it to climb from 50th to say 45 or 40 or something or maybe better,Premise
i would,Claim
its directly relevant,Claim
by his own budget numbers his proposals for spending on tax cuts for the wealthiest of the wealthy are more than the new spending proposals that he has made for health care and education and national defense all combined,Premise
according to his own numbers,Premise
its not a question of his heart,Claim
thats simply not true what he just said that we spent  the top 1 receive 223 as opposed to 445 billion in new spending,Claim
the top 1 will pay onethird of all the federal income taxes,Premise
lets talk about my tax plan,Premise
in return get onefifth of the benefits because most of the tax reductions go to the people at the bottom end of the economic ladder,Premise
that stands in stark contrast by the way to a man who is going to leave 50 million  50 million americans out of tax relief,Claim
we just have a different point of view,Claim
its a totally different point of view,Claim
he believes only the right people ought to get tax relief,Premise
i believe everybody who pays taxes ought to get tax relief,Claim
let me go back to texas for example for a minute,Premise
we pay 47 billion,Premise
i cant emphasize to you how much,Premise
i signed a bill that puts chips in place,Premise
the bill finally came out at the end of the 1999 session,Premise
were working hard to sign up children,Claim
were doing it faster than any other state our size comparable state,Premise
were making really good progress,Premise
our state cares a lot about our children,Claim
my priority is going to be the health of our citizens,Claim
these folks have had eight years to get something done in washington dc on the uninsured,Premise
they have not done it,Claim
theyve had eight years to get something done on medicare,Premise
they have not got it done,Claim
you need to get somebody that knows how to bring republicans and democrats together to get positive things done for america,Claim
if you want change,Premise
if youre happy with inactivity stay with the horse,Claim
i do,Claim
i think that in this 21st century we will soon see the consequences of whats called global warming,Claim
there was a study just a few weeks ago suggesting that in summertime the north polar ice cap will be completely gone in 50 years,Premise
already many people see the strange weather conditions that the old timers say theyve never seen before in their lifetimes,Premise
whats happening is the level of pollution is increasing significantly,Premise
we can create millions of good new jobs by being first into the market with these new kinds of cars and trucks and other kinds of technologies,Claim
if we take the leadership role and build the new technologies like the new kinds of cars and trucks that detroit is itching to build,Premise
theyre moving very rapidly,Claim
the japanese are breathing down our necks on this,Premise
they know that it is a fastgrowing world market,Premise
some of these other countries particularly in the developing world their pollution is much worse than anywhere else and their people want higher standards of living,Premise
theyre looking for ways to satisfy their desire for a better life and still reduce pollution at the same time,Premise
i think that holding onto the old ways and the old argument that the environment and the economy are in conflict is really outdated,Claim
we have to be bold,Claim
we have to provide leadership,Claim
we disagree on this,Claim
the governor said that he doesnt think this problem is necessarily caused by people,Premise
hes for letting the oil companies into the arctic national wildlife refuge,Premise
houston has just become the smoggiest city in the country,Premise
texas is number one in industrial pollution,Premise

let me start with texas,Premise
we are a big industrial state,Premise
we reduced our industrial waste by 11,Premise
we cleaned up more brown fields than any other administration in my states history 450 of them,Premise
our water is cleaner now,Premise
a brown field is an abandoned industrial site that just sits idle in some of our urban centers,Premise
people are willing to invest capital in the brown fields dont want to do so for fear of lawsuit,Premise
i think we ought to have federal liability protection depending upon whether or not standards have been met,Claim
the book you mentioned that vice president gore wrote he also called for taxing  big energy taxes in order to clean up the environment,Premise
now that the energy prices are high i guess hes not advocating those big energy taxes right now,Premise
i believe we ought to fully fund the land and water conservation fund to  with half the money going to states so states can make the right decisions for environmental quality,Claim
i think we need to have clean coal technologies,Claim
i propose 2 billion worth,Claim
i just found out the other day an interesting fact that there is a national petroleum reserve right next to  in prudhoe bay that your administration opened up for exploration in that pristine area,Premise
it was a smart move,Claim
theres gas reserves up there,Premise
we need gas pipelines to bring the gas down,Premise
we need to make sure that if we decontrol our plants that theres mandatory  that the plants must conform to clean air standards the grandfathered plants,Claim
thats what we did in texas,Premise
no excuses,Premise
you must conform,Premise
there are practical things we can do,Claim
it starts with working in a collaborative effort with states and local folks,Claim
if you own the land every day is earth day,Premise
people care a lot about their land and care about their environment,Premise
im really strongly committed to clean water and clean air and cleaning up the new kinds of challenges like global warming,Claim
im not in favor of energy taxes,Claim
i am in favor of tax cuts to encourage and give incentives for the quicker development of these new kinds of technologies,Claim
detroit is rearing to go on that,Premise
i dont think you can get results that way,Claim
we differ on the kinds of appointments that we would make,Claim
we differ on the arctic national wildlife refuge,Premise
we differ on whether or not pollution controls ought to be voluntary,Premise
i think its a fundamental difference,Claim
i dont believe in command and control out of washington dc,Claim
i believe washington ought to set standards,Claim
i think we ought to be collaborative at the local levels,Claim
i think we ought to work with people at the local levels,Claim
thats what we ought to do at the federal level when it comes to grandfathered plants for utilities,Claim
the electric decontrol bill that i fought for and signed in texas has mandatory emission standards,Premise
i think theres a difference,Claim
for example take  when they took 40 million acres of land out of circulation without consulting local officials i thought that was  out in the west  on the logging issue,Premise
thats not the way i would have done it,Claim
i certainly would have consulted with governors and elected officials before i would have acted unilaterally,Claim
sure absolutely so long as theyre based upon science and theyre reasonable,Claim
so long as people have input,Claim
i think its an issue that we need to take very seriously,Claim
i dont think we know the solution to global warming yet,Claim
i dont think weve got all the facts before we make decisions,Claim
im not going to let the united states carry the burden for cleaning up the worlds air,Claim
like kyoto treaty would have done,Premise
china and india were exempted from that treaty,Premise
i think we need to be more evenhanded,Claim
as evidently 99 senators  i think it was 99 senators supported that position,Premise
a lot of the supporters of the kyoto treaty actually ended up voting for that because the way it was worded,Claim
theres no doubt theres a lot of opposition to it in the senate,Premise
im not for command and control techniques either,Claim
im for working with the groups not just with industry but also with the citizen groups and local communities,Claim
to control sprawl in ways that the local communities themselves come up with,Premise

weather patterns are changing,Premise
storms are getting more violent and unpredictable,Premise

i want to be able to tell my grandson when im in my later years that i didnt turn away from the evidence that showed that we were doing some serious harm,Premise
i believe that  that we ought to recognize the value to our children and grandchildren of taking steps that preserve the environment in a way thats good for them,Claim
in my faith tradition it is  its written in the book of matthew where your heart is there is your treasure also,Premise

but science theres a lot  theres differing opinions,Premise
before we react i think its best to have the full accounting full understanding of whats taking place,Claim
i think both of us care a lot about the environment,Claim
we may have different approaches,Premise
we may have different approaches in terms of how we deal with local folks,Premise

i thought during his debate with senator bradley saying he authored the eitc when it didnt happen,Premise

i think this is an issue,Claim
i found it to be an issue in trying to defend my tax relief package,Premise
i thought there was some exaggerations about the numbers,Premise

thats what debates are about,Premise
thats what campaigns are about,Premise
i got some of the details wrong last week in some of the examples that i used,Premise
im sorry about that,Premise
im going to try to do better,Claim
getting a detail wrong interfered several times with the point that i was trying to make,Claim
however many days that young girl in florida stood in her classroom however long even if it was only one day doesnt change the fact that there are a lot of overcrowded classrooms in america and we need to do something about that,Premise
there are seniors who pay more for their prescriptions than a lot of other people more than their pets sometimes,Premise
more sometimes than people in foreign countries,Premise
we need to do something about that,Claim
not with the measure that leaves the majority of them without any real basic help until the next presidents term of four years is over but right away,Claim
i cant promise that i will never get another detail wrong,Claim
i can promise you that i will try not to and hard,Claim
that means doing it under the medicare program,Claim
i will promise you this with all the confidence in my heart and in the world that i will do my best if im elected president ill work my heart out to get the big things right for the american people,Claim
i think anybody would have a hard time explaining that clearly in a way that makes sense to the average person,Claim
i think the point of that is that anybody would have a hard time trying to make a tax cut plan that is so large that would put us into such big deficits that gives almost half the benefits to the wealthiest of the wealthy,Claim
thats the kind of exaggeration i was just talking about,Premise
i wasnt the one having trouble explaining it,Premise
education is my number one priority,Claim
i think that its the most important big major change that we can bring in our country,Claim
this race is about values,Premise
its about change,Premise
its about giving choices to the american people,Premise
we should have new accountability testing of students,Claim
i think that we should require states to test all students test schools and school districts,Claim
i think that we should go further and require teacher testing for new teachers also,Claim
the difference is that while my plan starts with new accountability and maintains local control it doesnt stop there,Claim
i want to give new choices to parents,Claim
send their kids to college with a 10000 tax deduction for college tuition per child per year,Claim
i want to reduce the size of the classrooms in this country,Claim
so that students can get more oneonone time with teachers,Premise
the way to do that is first to recruit more teachers,Claim
ive a plan in my budget to recruit 100000 new highly qualified teachers and to help local school districts build new schools,Claim
i think that we have to put more emphasis on early learning and preschool,Claim
you cant make education the top priority,Claim
if you squander the surplus on a huge tax cut that goes mostly to those at the top,Premise
you cant do education,Claim
if the tax cut is your number one two three and four priority,Premise
you cant do both,Claim
you have to choose,Claim
i choose education and health care the environment and retirement security,Claim
im running to get some things done for america,Claim
theres too many issues left unresolved,Premise
theres been too much finger pointing and too much name calling in washington dc,Premise
i would like to unite this country to get an agenda done that will speak to the hopes and aspirations of the future,Claim

no child should be left behind in america,Premise
i want to make sure we rebuild our military to keep the peace,Claim

this issue has been too long on the table because its been a political issue,Premise
its time to bring folks together to say that all seniors will get prescription drug coverage,Premise
i want to do something about social security,Claim
its an important priority,Claim
now is the time to act,Premise
were going to say to our seniors our promises weve made to you will be promises kept,Claim
younger workers in order to make sure the system exists tomorrow younger workers ought to be able to take some of your own money and invest it in safe securities to get a better rate of return on that money,Claim
i do believe in tax relief,Claim
i believe we can set our priorities,Claim
i dont believe like the vice president does in huge government,Claim
i believe in limited government,Claim
we can send some of the money back to the people who pay the bills,Claim
by having a limited government and a focused government,Premise
i want to have tax relief for all people who pay the bills in america,Claim
you can spend your money more wisely than the federal government can,Premise
were not spending any more than is projected by the experts unlike our opponents,Claim
were setting aside 300 billion in a reserve fund in case the projections the nonpartisan experts make arent quite right,Claim
we understand that balancing the budget keeping america out of debt is a way to keep interest rates down and the economy growing,Claim
i think this is an extraordinarily important decision well make on november 7th,Claim
i think we have to make some planning assumption to proceed,Claim
there are important issues out there that need to be resolved,Claim
its important for us to get on with that business,Premise
were really going to choose between what i consider to be an old way of governing ourselves of high levels of spending high taxes ever more intrusive bureaucracy,Premise
or a new course a new era if you will,Premise
governor bush and i want to offer that new course of action,Claim
we cant make 12month decisions in this business,Premise
were talking about the kinds of fundamental changes in programs and government that are going to affect peoples lives for the next 25 or 30 years,Premise
it may be a little risky in some respects from an economic standpoint to try to forecast surpluses,Claim
the last eight years we ignored a lot of these problems,Claim
we havent moved aggressively on social security on medicare,Premise
i think public education is a solution,Claim
we believe very much in the public school system,Claim
im a product of public schools my family wife and daughters all went to public schools,Premise
we think its extraordinarily important,Claim
we think we know how to do it,Claim
thats unacceptable from our standpoint,Claim
weve had a significant increase in spending for education nationwide,Premise
it has produced almost no positive results,Premise
the achievement gap between minority and nonminority students is as big as itâ€™s ever been,Claim
theres been no progress on reading scores in the last eight years,Premise
almost no progress on math,Premise
we now have in our most disadvantaged communities 70 of our fourth graders cant read at the basic level of understanding,Premise
weve graduated 15 million kids from high school in the last few years who cant read at a significant level,Claim
they are permanently sentenced to a lifetime of failure,Claim
we want to do is to change that,Premise
governor bush has done it in texas,Premise
the worst things we can do is fail to establish high standards,Claim
we dont have the same kind of expectations from you that we have from everybody else,Premise
probably the single most important issue in this campaign,Premise
governor bush has made it clear that when hes elected this will be his number one priority as a legislative measure to submit to the congress,Claim
we have to test every child every year to know whether or not were making progress with respect to achieving those goals and objectives,Claim
we want to insist on high standards,Claim
we want accountability,Claim
al gore and i are committed to making americas public schools the best in the world,Claim
i think both of us agree that leaving aside the social security and medicare surpluses,Claim
theres 18 trillion in surplus available to spend over the next ten years,Premise
you cannot reform education and improve it in this country without spending some money,Claim
al gore and i have committed 170 billion for that purpose,Premise
to recruit 100000 new teachers to reduce the size of classrooms,Premise
to help local school districts build new buildings so our children are not learning in crumbling classrooms,Premise
i disagree with what my opponent has said,Premise
a lot of progress has been made in recent years,Claim
average testing scores are up and a lot of extraordinary work is being done by tens of thousands of parents teachers and administrators all around america,Premise
our opponents are going to spend 16 trillion of the 18 trillion surplus projected on that big tax cut that al gore talked about the other night so effectively,Premise
were saving money to invest in education,Claim
were taking 300 billion off the top to put in reserve fund,Claim
the rest well use for middle class tax cuts and invest in programs like education,Claim
were going to go on and give the middle class the ability to deduct up to 10000 a year in the cost of college tuition,Claim
that is a tremendous lifesaving change which will help people carry on their education,Premise
allow them to develop the kinds of skills that will help them succeed in the hitech economy of today,Premise
we think it is appropriate to return to the american people so that they can make choices themselves in how that money ought to be spent,Claim
whether on education retirement or on paying their bills,Premise
we think its extraordinarily important to do that,Claim
we take half of the projected surplus and set it aside for social security,Claim
we take roughly a fourth of it for other urgent priorities such as medicare reform and education several of these other key programs we want to support,Claim
we take roughly onefourth of it and return it in the form of a tax cut to the american taxpayer,Claim
we want to give them the opportunity to make those kinds of choices for themselves,Claim
we think this is a totally reasonable approach,Claim
the average american family is paying about 40 in federal state and local taxes,Premise
the program that we put together we think is very responsible,Claim
they are some 900 billion in spending over and above that surplus already,Premise
suggestion that somehow all of it is going for tax cuts isnt true,Premise
we want to take about 5 of that and return that to the american taxpayer in the form of tax relief,Claim
we have the highest level of taxation now weve had since world war ii,Claim
al gore and i are committed to balancing the budget every year,Claim
the surplus in the medicare trust fund should also be locked up with a sign on it that says â€œpoliticians keep your hands offâ€ our opponents do not do that,Claim
they raid the medicare trust fund to pay for well their tax cut and other programs that they cant afford,Claim
theyve spent so much on the tax cut,Premise
when interest rates go up so too do the cost of mortgage payments car payments student loans credit card transactions,Premise
we go back down the road to higher interest rates to higher unemployment to a kind of selftax increase on every american family,Claim
when you add on the other spending programs that our opponents have committed to plus the cost of their plan to privatize social security by our calculations theyre 11 trillion in debt,Premise
the numbers show that 16 trillion goes to the big tax cut,Premise
the paying off the debt by the year 2012 when by our calculation our opponents economic plan still leaves america 28 trillion in debt,Claim
if weve learned anything over the last eight years is to be fiscally responsible,Claim
the first way we will do that is by supporting the equal pay act which has been proposed in congress,Claim
which gives women the right to file legal actions against employers who are not treating them fairly and not paying them equally,Claim
were going to do everything we can using governmental support of business agencies to help women business owners have an opportunity to invest and begin businesses and make larger incomes themselves,Claim
al gore and i have issued an economic plan in which weve stated specific goals for the future,Premise
one of those goals is to eliminate the pay gap between men and women,Claim
its unfair and its unacceptable,Premise
fortunately great advances have been made by women achieving the kind of equality that they were too long denied,Premise
actually the number i have received 72 cents for every 1 a man receives in a comparable job,Premise
there are other civil rights and human rights laws that i think can come to play here,Claim
this is an unfair and unacceptable situation,Premise
weve not achieved genuine equality in this country,Claim
even though as the economy has risen in the last eight years americas women have risen with it and received more income,Premise
until women are receiving the same amount of pay for the same job theyre doing as a man receives,Premise
al gore and i are committed to closing that gap and achieving that equality,Claim
many families women are a significant bread earner or the only bread earner,Premise
this cause affects not only the women,Premise
families and the children as well,Claim
i share the view that we ought to have equal pay for equal work regardless of someones gender,Premise
we have made progress in recent years,Premise
i think we have a ways to go,Claim
the proposal we have from al gore basically doesnt do that,Claim
were trying to change and address in the course of the campaign and what our agenda is for the future,Premise
our plans are for the future focus very much about giving as much control as we can to individual americans,Claim
be they men or women be they single or married,Premise
as much control as possible over their own lives,Claim
especially in the area of taxation,Premise
its not just about the differential with respect to women,Premise
they discriminate between stayathome moms with children that they take care of themselves and those who go to work or who in fact have their kids taken care of outside the home,Premise
t provides tax relief for absolutely everybody who pays taxes,Claim
if you live your life the way they want you to live your life if you behave in a certain way you qualify for a tax credit and at that point you get some relief,Claim
50 million american taxpayers out there get no advantages at all out of the gore tax proposal,Premise
whereas under the bush plan everybody who pays taxes will get tax relief,Claim
it in effect lays out some 29 separate tax credits,Claim
weâ€™re not going to give it all away in one big tax cut,Claim
certainly not to the 1 of the public that doesnt need it now,Claim
were focusing our tax cut on the middle class in the areas they tell us they need it,Claim
al gore and i want to live within our means,Premise
if a young couple making 50000 a year saves 1000 the government will put another 1000 in that account,Claim
the time they retire theyll not only have guaranteed social security,Premise
more than 200000 in that retirement fund,Claim
tax credits for better and more expensive child care,Premise
tax credits for middle class families that dont have health insurance from their employers,Premise
the number of 50 million americans not benefitting from our tax cut program is absolutely wrong,Claim
one of the many tax credits for the middle class includes a 500 tax credit for stayathome moms just as a way of saying we understand that you are performing a service for our society,Claim
we want you to have that tax credit,Premise
27 million americans dont get what the governor said they would in the tax program,Claim
we like tax reform and tax cuts,Claim
they like tax credits,Claim
the fact of the matter is the plan is so complex that the ordinary american is never going to ever figure out what they even qualify for,Claim
its a classic example of wanting to have a program in this case a tax program that will direct people to live their lives in certain ways rather than empowering them to make decisions for themselves,Premise
we also think banning the horrific practice of partial birth abortions is an area where there could be agreement,Claim
we want to reduce the incidence of abortion on our society,Claim
many on the prochoice side have said the same thing,Premise
even bill clinton has advocated reducing abortion to make it as rare as possible,Premise
that really was a question of whether or not it was safe to be used by women,Claim
with respect to the question of ru486 we believe that,Claim
congress has twice passed by overwhelming margins a significant number of votes from both parties the ban on partial birth abortions,Premise
twice its been vetoed by bill clinton and al gore,Premise
we would hope eventually they would recognize thats not a good position for them to be in,Claim
governor bush made it clear the other night he did not anticipate that he would be able to go in and direct the fda to reverse course on that particular issue,Claim
the decision they made was on the drug not the question of whether or not it would support abortion,Premise
my answer is no,Claim
i would not support legislation that is being introduced in congress to override the food and drug administration decision on ru486,Claim
the administration fda worked 12 years on this serious problem,Premise
we believe that the government ought to do everything it can to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies,Claim
i think its a decision we ought to let stand,Claim
it was made by experts,Premise
they made a judgment based on what was good for womens health,Premise
the significant difference here on this issue is that al gore and i respect and will protect a womans right to choose,Claim
our opponents will not,Claim
we know that this is a difficult personal moral medical issue,Premise
it ought to be left under our law to a woman her doctor and her god,Claim
the number of abortions,Claim
the number of abortions is actually down in america over the last eight years,Claim
over the last eight years the number of teenage pregnancies has dropped 20,Premise
it has is that there are good programs out there that al gore and i will continue to support,Claim
when the health of a woman is involved i think the government has to be respectful,Claim
i supported in fact a bill in the senate that would have prohibited lateterm abortions except in cases where the health or life of the mother was involved,Premise
i did not support the socalled partial birth abortion bill,Claim
it would have prohibited that form of abortion at any stage of the pregnancy regardless of the effect on the health and life of the woman,Premise
i think the united states with its european allies ought to do everything we can to encourage the people of serbia to do exactly what theyve been doing over the last few days to rise up and end this reign of terror by milosevic,Claim
bring themselves back into the family of nations where they will be welcomed by the united states and others,Claim
if that is not confirmed and does not happen,Premise
the encouraging news is that the state news agency is reporting that mr kostunica is the presidentelect,Claim
there are some press reports that are unconfirmed that say that milosevic has actually left belgrade,Claim
its the end of a reign of terror,Claim
that is a very happy ending to a terrible story,Premise
im very proud on this night as it appears that milosevic is about to or has fallen,Premise
the leadership role the united states played in the effort to stop his aggression and genocide in bosnia and kosovo,Claim
i think that vice president gore played a critical role passionate purposive role in leading the administration to do the right thing in the balkans,Claim
we stopped the aggression,Premise
strengthened our relationship with our european allies in nato,Claim
we stopped the genocide,Premise
made the united states more respected and trusted by our allies and more feared by our enemies,Premise
i know our opponents have said they thought it was overreaching,Premise
it wasnt,Premise
it was a matter of principle in americas national interest and values,Claim
hopefully tonight were seeing the final results of that bold and brave effort,Premise
i think probably more than anything else its a victory for the serbian people,Claim
i think this is an opportunity for the united states to test president putin of russia,Claim
i think he deserves a lot of credit for that,Claim
i do think its noteworthy that there appears to be an effort underway to get the russians involved,Claim
i think with respect to how this process has been managed most recently we want to do everything we can to support mr milosevics departure,Claim
i think we all admire that,Claim
i hope it marks the end of milosevic,Premise
theyve taken to the streets to support their democracy to support their vote,Premise
his is a continuation of a process that began ten years ago all across eastern europe and has only now arrived in serbia,Claim
we saw it in germany,Premise
we saw it in rumania,Premise
we saw it in czechoslovakia,Premise
the people of eastern europe rose up and made their claim for freedom,Premise
that would not involve committing us troops,Premise
governor bush suggested exactly that we ought to try to get the russians involved to exercise some leverage over the serbians,Premise
thats exactly what they were doing,Premise
governor bush was correct in his assessment and his recommendation,Claim
he has supported the administration on kosovo,Claim
he lobbied actively against passage of the byrdwarner provision,Claim
which would have set a specific deadline one he felt was too soon for forcing the us troops out,Premise
hes been supportive of the policy that weve seen with respect to yugoslavia,Claim
we ought to find out whether hes committed to democracy,Premise
whether or not hes willing to support the forces of freedom and democracy diplomatically there in the area of eastern europe,Premise
how we manage that process of integrating those 150 million eastern europeans into the security and economic framework of europe,Claim
its a test for him whether he represents the old guard in the soviet union,Claim
my preference is to deploy them as warriors,Claim
i think the role ought to be limited there ought to be a time limit on it,Claim
we have a military is to be able to fight and win wars,Claim
there may be occasion when its appropriate to use them in a peacekeeping role,Premise
to maintain with sufficient strength so that wouldbe adversaries are deterred from ever launching a war in the first place,Claim
i think that the administration has in fact in this area failed in a major responsibility,Claim
weve seen a reduction in our forces far beyond anything that was justified by the end of the cold war,Premise
weve seen a rapid expansion of our commitments around the world as troops have been sent hither and yon,Premise
a graduate of west point in 95 getting ready to get out of the service,Premise
the fact that the us military is worse off today than it was eight years ago,Claim
hes only allowed to train with his troops when fuel is available for the vehicles and only allowed to fire their weapons twice a year,Premise
if he had to send them into combat it would mean lives lost,Claim
that is a legitimate concern this is a very important area,Premise
were overcommitted and underresourced,Claim
this has had some other unfortunate effects,Claim
there was testimony before the joint chiefs of staff before the armed services committee that pointed out a lot of these problems,Premise
general mike ryan of the air force with 40 fewer aircraft hes now undertaking three times as many deployments on a regular basis as he had to previously,Premise
major responsibility for us in the future,Premise
a high priority for myself and governor bush to rebuild the us military and to give them the resources they need to do the job we ask them to do for us and give them good leadership,Claim
i want to assure the american people that the american military is the besttrained bestequipped most powerful force in the world,Claim
al gore and i will do whatever it takes to keep them that way,Claim
its not right,Claim
its not good for our military to run them down essentially in the midst of a partisan political debate,Premise
youve got to judge the military by what the military leaders say,Premise
secretary bill cohen a good republican and gen shelton the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff will both tell you the american military is ready to meet any threat we may face in the world today,Premise
judging by its results from desert storm to the balkans bosnia and kosovo the american military has performed brilliantly,Claim
this administration has turned around the drop in spending that began in the mid80s and right through the bushcheney administration and the early years of the clinton administration,Claim
now thatâ€™s stopped,Premise
we passed the largest pay increase in a generation for our military,Claim
the reality is if you look at our projected budgets for the next ten years al gore and i actually commit twice as much,Claim
100 billion in additional funding for our military than governor bush does,Premise
their budget allows nothing additional for acquisition of new weapons systems,Claim
thats something the same gen mike ryan of the airforce and all the other chiefs of the services will not be happy about,Claim
they need the new equipment the new systems that al gore and i are committed to giving them,Premise
no one has a higher regard than i do for them,Claim
i have enormous regard for the men and women of the us military,Claim

when we dont give them the spare parts they need,Premise
when we dont give our pilots the flying hours they need to maintain their proficiency,Premise
when we dont give them the kind of leadership that spells out what their mission is and lets them know why theyre putting their lives at risk,Premise
we undermine that morale,Claim
thats an extraordinarily valuable trust,Premise
we have not been investing in the future of the us military,Claim
there is no more important responsibility for a president of the united states than his role as commander in chief,Claim
the obligation he undertakes on behalf o fall of us when he decides when to send our young men and women to war,Claim
when we send them without the right kind of training,Premise
when we send them poorly equipped or with equipment thats old and broken down,Premise
we put their lives at risk,Claim
we will suffer more casualties in the next conflict if we dont look to those basic fundamental problems now,Claim
this administration has a bad track record in this regard,Claim
its available for anybody who wants to look at the record and wants to talk to our men and women in uniform,Premise
wants to spend time with the members of the joint chiefs,Premise
wants to look at readiness levels and other  other indicators,Premise
the issue of procurement is very important,Claim
were running now off the buildup of the investment we made during the reagan years,Premise
weve taken money out of the procurement budget to support other ventures,Claim
as that equipment gets old it has to be replaced,Premise
yes of course its an important debate to have as part of this campaign,Claim
i dont want either the military to feel uneasy or the american people to feel insecure,Premise
al gore and i are committed to continuing this acquisition program transforming the military,Claim
al gore and i will do whatever is necessary to keep it that way,Claim
the soldiers there have a higher rate of reenlistment than anywhere else in the service,Claim
they feel a sense of purpose a sense of mission,Premise
in the areas where our opponents have said we are overextended,Premise
this administration has begun to transform the american military to take it away from being a cold war force to prepare it to meet the threats of the new generation of tomorrow,Claim
we are ready to meet any contingency that might arise,Claim
we have met our recruitment targets in each of the services this year,Claim
governor bush recommended in his major policy statement on the military earlier this year that we skip the next generation of military equipment,Premise
that would really cripple our readiness,Premise
exactly the readiness that dick cheney is talking about,Claim
persontoperson personbyperson unitbyunit this is the most powerful and effective military,Claim
not only in the world today,Premise
in the history of the world,Claim
theres still fewer people in uniform today,Premise
america has a national strategic interest and principled interest in peace in the middle east,Claim
al gore and i will continue to do that,Claim
weve been on a very constructive course in the middle east played an unusual unique role,Claim
i hope i might through my friendships in israel and throughout the arab world play a unique role in bringing peace,Premise
so much work has been done by the people there with the support of this administration,Premise
so much progress has been made in the original oslo agreements between the israelis the palestinians adopted in 1993 and the peace between israel and jordan thereafter,Premise
al gore has played a critical role in advancing that process over the last eight years,Claim
these two peoples have come in some senses generations forward centuries forward in the last seven years,Premise
they are so close to a final peace agreement,Claim
i hope and pray that the death and unrest in the last week will not create the kinds of scars that make it hard for them to go back to the peace table with american assistance and achieve,Premise
im convinced the great majority of the israeli and palestinian people want,Claim
i think its very important that we have an administration where we have a president with firm leadership who has the kind of track record of dealing straight with people,Claim
of keeping his word so friends and allies both respect us and our adversaries fear us,Claim
i think barak has tried to same thing,Claim
the next administration is going to be the one that is going to have to come to grips with the current state of affairs there,Claim
we were able to i think reassure both arabs and israelis would play a major role there,Claim
i think also a lot of credit goes to some great men like yitzak rabin,Claim
we made significant breakthroughs i think at the end of the bush administration,Claim
the gulf war,Premise
numerous administrations going back certainly to world war ii have had to wrestle with the problem of what should happen to the middle east,Premise
we had joined together with arab allies and done enormous damage to the iraqi armed forces,Premise

we were able to convene them in a conference,Claim
the first time arab and israelis sat down facetoface and began this process of trying to move the peace process forward,Premise
his tragic passing was of great consequence a great tragedy for everybody who cares about peace in the middle east,Claim
he was a man who had the military stature to be able to confidently persuade the israelis to take risks for peace,Premise
the soviets were no longer a factor,Premise
they used to fish in troubled waters whenever they had the opportunity in the middle east,Premise
iraq was the biggest military threat to israel,Claim
i dont think you can afford to have a man like saddam hussein with nuclear weapons in the middle east,Claim
we might have no other choice,Claim
well have to see if that happens,Claim
were in a situation today where our posture with iraq is weaker than it was at the end of the war,Claim
its unfortunate,Claim
i also think its unfortunate we find ourselves in a position where we dont know for sure what might be transpiring inside iraq,Claim
if in fact saddam hussein were taking steps to try to rebuild nuclear capability or weapons of mass destruction you would have to give very serious consideration to military action to  to stop that activity,Claim

we have never been asked to send troops to the west bank,Claim
it had 26 separate maps they had to sign,Premise
literally thousands of delineations of who would do what on the west bank,Premise
i believe if the parties will get together and in a goodfaith manner make that agreement that theyll be able to do it if we cannot impose a peace on the middle east,Claim
my position has always been that the job of the united states was to minimize the risks of peace,Claim
if they asked me to be part of some monitoring force  as we are in the sinai and have been since 1978  to monitor the peace between egypt and israel frankly i would have to think about it,Premise
i would have to see what they wanted to do,Premise
i dont believe that will be the request,Premise

dont be too discouraged,Premise
there is a big difference in the defense budget,Claim

when i asked yassir arafat and prime minister netanyahu to come to washington and got them together and they talked alone for three hours,Premise
i was convinced that they had to have a chance to make that peace,Claim
if they asked us to play some reasonable role i dont know how i would respond,Premise
it would depend entirely on what they asked us to do,Premise
the real secret there is for them to abide by the agreements theyve made and find a way to trust each other,Claim
theyre going to have to spend some time and trust each other,Claim
prime minister rabin gave his life believing that that trust could be materialized,Claim
i still think it can be,Claim
it seems to me what we need to do is to talk about not only tobacco but drugs,Claim
drug use between 12 and 17yearolds has doubled in this administration in the last 44 months,Premise
marijuana use is up 141percent,Premise
cocaine use up 160 percent,Premise
its all happening in this administration,Claim
they cut funding and they cut interdiction,Premise
theyre your kids,Premise
the first vote we had was whether or not you should put a little notice on cigarettes,Premise
i voted i for everything since that time,Premise
in fact 1992 we had a bill come before us that all the states had to comply or theyre going to lose certain money,Premise
we sent it to the clinton administration for implementation,Claim
they waited three and a half years,Claim
during that period about 3000 young kids every day started smoking,Claim
thats about three million,Premise
not until again in 1996  i dont want anybody to smoke,Premise
my brother probably died partly because of cigarettes,Premise
when im president of the united states were going to use the national guard and whatever sources we need to stop some of the drugs coming into america,Claim
if you stop the drugs nobody is going to use the drugs,Claim
so dont smoke dont drink dont use drugs,Claim
the question of what the federal government should do to limit the access of tobacco to young people is one of the biggest differences between senator dole and me,Premise
we did propose a regulation six months after i became president under the law he mentioned,Claim
it simply says all these states  it made it illegal for kids to smoke,Claim
they have to try harder if they want to keep getting federal funds,Premise
we started the  also in 93 to look into whether cigarettes were addictive enough for the federal food and drug administration to ban the ability of cigarette companies to advertise market and distribute their products to our kids,Premise
no president had ever taken on the tobacco lobby before,Claim
i did,Claim
senator dole opposed me,Claim

thats a lot of marijuana,Premise
thats a big supply,Premise
ive been awol for 44 months,Premise
they havent even done it,Premise
nobody should smoke young or old,Claim
particularly young people should not smoke,Claim
my record is there,Claim

ive voted eight ten times since 1965,Claim
they havent said whats going to happen,Premise
whether theyre going to have it declared addictive,Premise
once its a drug does it apply only to teenagers or everybody in america,Premise
social security and medicare are entirely different in terms of the financial stabilities,Claim
there are two different things,Premise
social security is stable until as you pointed out at least the third decade of the next century,Claim
wed like to have a social security fund that has about 70 years of life instead of about 30 years of life,Premise
what we have to do is simply to make some adjustments to take account of the fact that the baby boomers people like me are bigger in number than the people that went just before us and the people that come just after us,Premise
i think what well plainly do is what we did in 1983 when senator dole served,Claim
this is something i think he did a good job on when he served on the social security commission,Claim
they made some modest changes in social security to make sure that it would be alive and well into the 21st century,Claim
we will do that,Premise
its obvious that there are certain things that have to be done,Claim
there are 50 or 60 different options,Premise
a bipartisan commission to take it out of politics will make recommendations and build support for the people,Premise
medicare is different,Premise
medicare needs help now,Premise
i have proposed a budget which would put ten years on the life of the medicare trust fund,Claim
thats more than its had a lot of the time in the last years,Premise
it would save a lot of money through more managed care by giving more options more preventative care and lowering the inflation rate,Claim
the prices were paying providers without having the kind of big premium increases and outofpocket costs that the budget i vetoed would provide,Claim
that would give us ten years to do with medicare what were going to do with social security,Claim
have a bipartisan group look at what we have to do to save it when the baby boomers retire,Claim
we ought to pass this budget now and put ten years on it right away so no one has to worry about it,Premise
if youre somebody thinking about the future i think its fair to say that itll be  well work it out,Claim
this is a political year and the president is playing politics with medicare,Premise
i think if i were a senior citizen i would be a little fed up with all these ads scaring seniors scaring veterans and scaring students about education,Claim
after this year is over well resolve it just as we did with social security in 83,Claim
its a nonpartisan commission,Premise
ronald reagan got together with tip oneill and howard baker two republicans and one democrat,Premise
they appointed a commission i was on that commission,Premise
we resolved we rescued social security,Claim
we suggested  i think it has been over a year ago now  we do the same with medicare and the white house called it a gimmick,Claim
last week i guess it was donna shalala said well well cut medicare a hundred billion and appoint a commission,Claim
it will probably have to be done by a commission,Premise
take it out of politics,Premise
we have ideas in the dolekemp campaign,Claim
we will rescue medicare as we did social security,Claim
when you dont have any ideas you dont have any agenda and all you have is fear thats all you can use,Premise
their idea was to have the poorest seniors in the country pay 270 more this year,Claim
their idea was a budget that the that the american hospital association said could close 700 hospitals,Claim
their idea was to charge everybody more outofpocket costs in their budget that i vetoed,Claim
not in an election year,Claim
i told them in early 95,Premise
senator dole said 30 years ago he was one of 12 people who voted against medicare and he was proud of it,Premise
a year ago he said i was right then,Premise
i knew it wouldnt work,Premise
american seniors have the highest life expectancy in the world,Claim
we need to reform it,Claim
not wreck it,Premise
weve taken the first step,Claim
took it three steps,Premise
twice we sent welfare reform to the president,Claim
he vetoed it,Claim
on the third time we sent welfare reform to the president he signed it but announced he would change it next year,Premise
the vice president said they were going to do something else through the line item veto which ive never understood,Premise
what we need to do is make certain we try to return people to work,Claim
im standing here as someone who a long time ago as the county attorney in russell kansas one of our jobs every month was go through all the welfare checks and sign them,Premise
three of those checks were my grandparents,Premise
i know what its like to have to look welfare headon,Premise
we provided more money for daycare in the bill that passed the senate was vetoed then it came back and the president signed pretty much the same bill,Claim
if you want to get off medicare get back in the mainstream were going to provide jobs,Claim
were going to say you have a fiveyear limit,Claim
you can be on welfare,Premise
you got two years to look for a job,Premise
youre not going to go without food and youre not going to go without medical care,Claim
some people are going to need help,Premise
i dont think we ought to be giving welfare payments to illegal immigrants,Claim
it puts a heavy burden on a state like  except for emergencies,Premise
it puts a heavy burden on a states like california,Premise
it costs california taxpayers 3 billion dollars a year,Premise
its illegal right now and has been for years for illegal immigrants to get welfare benefits,Claim
that this is one of the most important issues in the world to me,Premise
i started working on welfare reform in 1980,Premise
i was sick of seeing people trapped in a system that was increasingly isolating them and making their kids more vulnerable to get in trouble,Premise
ive been working on it when i was a governor for a long time,Premise
when i became president i used the authority i had in this law to get out from certain federal rules to help states move people to work,Claim
we reduced the welfare rolls by 2 million already,Premise
ive got a plan with this new welfare reform law to work with the private sector to give employees specific tax incentives to hire people off welfare,Claim
to do some other things which will create more jobs in the private sector at least a million and move more people from welfare to work,Claim
i still remember a woman that i met ten years ago who said she wanted to get off welfare so her kids could tell give an answer when they say what does your mother do for a job i met that woman again,Premise
shes got four kids,Premise
ones got a good job ones studying to be a doctor,Premise
ones in technical school ones an honor student in high school,Premise
i want to make more people like that woman lily harden so ive got a plan to do it and its just beginning,Claim
weve got a great economic package,Claim
acrosstheboard tax cut,Premise
child credits,Claim
500 per child under 18,Premise
reduce the capital gains rate,Claim
create more jobs and opportunities for people on and off welfare,Claim
we have other provisions,Premise
less litigation,Claim
the trial lawyers big supporters of the president,Premise
the trial lawyers of course they like lawsuits so every time they have a bill that they want vetoed the president vetoes it for them,Claim
weve got to understand in america that weve got to have growth create more jobs and more opportunities in the private sector,Claim
the president takes credit for all these people off welfare,Premise
the governors did that,Premise
theyre created in the private sector,Claim
the government doesnt create jobs,Premise
federal government doesnt do that,Premise
we have a big plan to reduce the capital gains tax when people sell their homes,Claim
part of my tax package which is paid for in my balanced budget plan would exempt up to half a million dollars in gains from people when they sell their homes,Claim
i think is the biggest capital gains benefit we could give to most ordinary americans,Claim
we also have capital gains now for people that invest in new small businesses and hold the investment for five years,Claim
it was part of our other economic plan,Premise
these are things i think that will go a long way toward helping america build a stronger economy and a better tax system,Claim
i think the most important thing to emphasize though is that we also have to help people in other ways to build a strong economy,Claim
we cant have any tax cut thats not paid for,Claim
one of the big differences between senator dole and myself is that i told you how im going to pay for every penny of the tax cuts i recommend,Claim
weve worked hard to bring this deficit down and thats helped people in the real estate business,Claim
the interest rates are lower,Premise
weve got home ownership at a 15year high,Premise
weve got this country going in the right direction,Premise
we can have a tax cut,Claim
my priority would be to help the families who need it with child rearing and education and buying a firsttime home and helping for health care costs,Claim
if we cut the capital gains rate im told everyday i had a letter from a former constituent in kansas saying i want to sell property in california put it in my business in kansas i cant,Claim
the capital gains rates too high,Premise
what the president didnt tell you is all his tax cuts expire the year 2000,Claim
these increases go on forever,Claim
thats the liberal approach,Premise
give you a little tax cut give you a couple of years then make the tax increases go on forever,Premise
the net tax increase in his plans somewhere between 60 and 80 billion dollars,Claim
we have in the dolekemp economic plan unless unless your homes worth over 500000 dollars,Claim

there are 7 trillion dollars in assets locked up in america,Premise
its the american way,Premise
we need to get the economy going,Premise
thatll help social security,Claim
thatll create more jobs,Claim
thatll help people who want to get off welfare,Claim
before senator dole left the senate he and mr gingrich also were recommending that we pass these tax cuts only insofar as we could pay for them,Premise
we all assume that the tax cuts will be permanent,Premise
we have to prove we can pay for them,Claim
he left the senate we abandoned that,Claim
thats why most experts say that this tax scheme will blow a huge hole in the deficit raise interest rates and weaken the economy,Premise
that will take away all the benefits of the tax cut with a weaker economy,Premise
thats why we have to balance the budget,Premise
i will tell you how im going to pay for anything i promise you line by line,Claim
you should expect that from both of us,Premise
i think age is very  you know wisdom comes from age experience and intelligence,Claim
if you have some of each  and i have some age some experience and some intelligence  that adds up to wisdom,Premise

of course the president will take credit for that,Premise
my view is we want to find jobs and opportunities and education,Claim
this year the republican congress as far as student loans went from 24 billion to 36 billion over the next six years,Claim
a 50 percent increase,Premise
the highest appropriation,Premise
in our economic plan the 500 child credit can be used for young people rolled over and over and over you of course not this age,Claim
if you have a child two years old 7 percent interest would be worth about 18000 by the time that child was ready for college,Claim
we also raised the amount of each pell grant,Premise
6 billion dollars for pell grants very very important,Claim
i dont think senator dole is too old to be president,Premise
its the age of his ideas that i question,Claim
youre almost not old enough to remember this,Premise
we tried this before promising people an election year tax cut thats not paid for,Claim
you tried it last time you ran,Claim

president clinton came to california in 1992,Premise
he said the centerpiece in my first four years is going to be a middle class tax cut,Premise
i am against quotas,Claim
im against giving anybody any kind of preference for something theyre not qualified for,Claim
i still believe that there is some discrimination,Premise

affirmative action is making that extra effort,Claim
we werent guaranteeing anything anybody anything except the chance to prove they were qualified the chance to prove that they could do it,Premise

i supported that route for some time,Claim
i think it gets back to experience,Claim
a little experience a little age a little intelligence,Claim
i noted that nobody was really benefitting except a very small group at the top,Premise
equal opportunity,Claim
the average person wasnt benefitting,Claim

one thing i did was oppose the government takeover health care that president clinton offered in 1993 which created 17 new taxes and 50 new bureaucracies and price controls,Claim
we were afraid the very thing you mentioned would have happened,Premise
i think right now we got to go back,Claim
i know theyve appointed a commission to take a look at managed care,Claim
everybody would have been forced into managed care,Claim
you couldnt have chosen your own doctor and that would have been the end,Premise
if we start to take choices away from people and if we drive them into one type care eliminate feeforservice altogether or eliminate the fact you can go to your own doctor you have to go somewhere else,Premise
i think weve taken a giant step backward in the united states of america,Claim
we have the best health care delivery system in the world and we want to keep it that way,Claim

im strongly in favor of a federal bill to repeal any gag rules on providers,Claim
i believe that doctors should not be able to be kicked out of managed care plans just because they tell the patients what they need,Claim
what more expensive care options might be,Claim
if were saving money and managing resources better thats a good thing,Claim
if were saving money and depriving people of care thats a bad thing,Claim
a good place to start is to say no managed care provider can gag a doctor and kick the doctor out of the managed care plan for the doctor,Premise
telling the patient you need a more expensive test,Premise
you need a more expensive procedure,Premise
your health requires it,Premise
i think what we want to avoid is falling back into this nationalized health care system that president clinton wanted to give us in 1993,Claim
if that isnt a liberal idea ive never heard one,Premise
17 new taxes price controls 50 new bureaucracies,Claim

i think that really frustrates people is that so often political campaigns seem to be more about the politicians that are running than the people,Claim
there is a connection,Premise
i think what we have to do is convince people there is a big difference,Claim
if you vote one way you will have a department of education in the 21st century,Claim
if you vote the other way you wont,Claim
if you vote one way you will have an expansion of family leave,Claim
if you vote the other way you will be lucky to save it,Claim

these are important questions,Premise
people have to decide,Premise

you can also use those accounts for health care or education or a first home,Premise
i think one thing sooner or later were going to have to consider is take a look at the social security system,Claim

this is one where we have some agreement,Claim
only about half the people in this country have pension plans,Premise
social security is not enough for a lot of people to live on,Claim
at least is not enough for them to maintain anything like their previous lifestyle,Claim
weve got to figure out how are we going to have more people with pension plans,Premise
pension coverage has been declining as more and more people work for small businesses and fewer people work for big businesses,Premise
we make more people eligible to save in an ira and let couples married couples save more and then they could withdraw from it taxfree if they needed to for medical emergencies or buy a home or education,Claim
they could also save to supplement retirement,Claim
we just passed a sweeping small business reform that makes it easier for small business people to take out 401 k plans for themselves and employees,Premise

ive just defined them,Claim
the white house did not uh  prevent the release of that report,Claim
on july twelfth of this year we gave full permission for the release of that report,Claim
i was very disappointed in the fact that the uh  gao released that report,Claim
i think it interjected political partisan politics at the present time,Claim
he was furious,Claim
he told me that it was the action of me president ford that saved the lives of the crew of the mayaguez,Premise
if we had not taken the strong and forceful action that we did we would have been criticized very very severely for sitting back and not moving,Claim
captain miller is thankful,Premise
the crew is thankful,Premise
we did the right thing,Claim
we made uh  diplomatic uh  protests to the cambodian government through the united nations,Premise
every possible diplomatic means was utilized,Premise
i had a responsibility and so did the national security coun council to meet the problem at hand,Premise
we handled it responsibly,Premise
i think captain millers testimony to that effect is the best evidence,Claim
im reluctant to uh comment on the recent report  i havent read it,Claim
i think the american people have only one  uh requirement  that the facts about mayaguez be given to them accurately and completely,Claim
mr ford has been there for eighteen months,Premise
he had the facts that were released today immediately after the mayaguez incident,Premise
i understand that the report today is accurate,Claim
i believe that it was accurate,Claim
i dont know if thats exactly accurate or not,Claim
i understand that both the  the uh  department of state and the defense department have approved the accuracy of todays report or yesterdays report and also the national security agency,Claim
i dont know what was right or what was wrong or what was done,Claim
i believe is that whatever the  the knowledge was that mr ford had should have been given to the american people eighteen months ago immediately after the mayaguez uh  incident occurred,Claim
i believe the president has an obligation to tell the american people the truth and not wait eighteen months later for the report to be issued,Claim
this is uh  what the american people want,Claim
when something happens that endangers our security,Premise
when something happens that threatens our stature in the world,Premise
when american people are endangered by the actions of a foreign country just forty uh sailors on the mayaguez we obviously have to move aggressively and quickly to rescue them,Premise
i believe that the boycott of american businesses by the arab countries,Claim
those businesses trade with israel,Premise
they have american jews who are owners or directors in the company is an absolute disgrace,Premise
this is the first time that ive  remember in the history of our country when weve let a foreign country circumvent or change our bill of rights,Claim
ill do everything i can as president to stop the boycott of american businesses by the arab countries,Claim
i dont believe that arab countries will pursue it when we have a strong president who will protect the integrity of our country the commitment of our constitution and bill of rights and protect people in this country who happen to be jews,Claim
it may later be catholics,Premise
it may be  later be baptists who are threatened by some foreign country,Premise
we ought to stand staunch,Claim
i think its a disgrace that so far mr fords administration has blocked the passage of legislation that wouldve revealed by law every instance of the boycott,Claim
again governor carter is inaccurate,Claim
the arab boycott action was first taken in 1952,Premise
in november of 1975 i was the first president to order the executive branch to take action affirmative action through the department of commerce and other cabinet departments to make certain that no american businessman or business organization should discriminate against jews because of an arab boycott,Premise
i might add that uh  my administration  and im very proud of it  is the first administration that has taken an antitrust action against companies in this country that have allegedly cooperated with the arab boycott,Premise
just on monday of this week i signed a tax bill that included an amendment that would prevent companies in the united states from taking a tax deduction if they have in any way whatsoever cooperated with the arab boycott,Premise
last week when we were trying to get the export administration act through the congress  necessary legislation  my administration went to capitol hill and tried to convince the house and the senate that we should have an amendment on that legislation which would take strong and effective action against those who uh  participate or cooperate with the arab uh boycott,Premise
the congress failed to act,Premise
i am going to announce tomorrow that the department of commerce will disclose those companies that have uh  participated in the arab boycott,Claim
if they do give us a bona fide complete uh  accounting of the eight hundred mias then i believe that the united states should begin negotiations for the uh  admission of vietnam to the united nations,Claim
but not until they have given us the full accounting of our mias,Claim
one of the uh  most embarrassing uh  failures of the ford administration and one that touches specifically on human rights is his refusal to appoint a presidential commission to go to vietnam to go to laos to go to cambodia and try to trade for the release of information about those who are missing in action in those wars,Claim
mr ford has not done it,Claim
weve had several fragmentary efforts by members of the congress and by  by private citizens,Premise
several months ago the vietnam government said we are ready to sit down and negotiate for release of information on mias,Premise
mr ford has not responded,Claim
i would never normalize relationships with vietnam nor permit them to join the united nations until theyve taken this action,Claim
thats not enough,Claim
we need to have an active and aggressive action on the part of the president the leader of his country to seek out every possible way to get that information which has kept the mia families in despair and doubt,Premise
mr ford has just not done it,Claim
the purpose of this debate and the outcome of the election will determine three basic things,Premise
leadership,Premise
upholding the principles of our country,Premise
proper priorities and commitments for the future,Premise
this election will also determine what kind of world we leave our children,Claim
i believe we can and we ought to,Claim
weve been hurt in recent years in this country,Premise
in the aftermath of vietnam cambodia chile pakistan angola watergate cia weve been hurt,Premise
our people feel that weve lost something precious,Claim
i wanna see our nation  return to a posture and an image and a standard to make us proud once again,Premise
i remember the world with nato and the world of point four and the world of the marshall plan and the world of the peace corps,Premise
we ought to be a beacon for nations who search for peace and who search for freedom who search for individual liberty who search for basic human rights,Claim
we havent been lately,Premise
we can be once again,Premise
well never have that world leadership until we are strong at home,Claim
we can have that strength if we return to the basic principles,Claim
it ought not to be a strength of bombast and threats,Claim
it ought to be a quiet strength based on the integrity of our people,Claim
the vision of the constitution,Claim
an in innate strong will and purpose that gods given us in the greatest nation on earth  the united states,Claim
america is strong,Claim
america is free,Claim
america is respected,Claim
foreign policy and defense policy are difficult and complex issues,Premise
we can debate methods,Premise
we can debate one decision or another,Premise
there are two uh things which cannot be debated  experience and results,Claim
not a single young american today is fighting or dying on any foreign battlefield,Claim
america is at peace and with freedom,Claim
if we cut the defense budget by three to five billion dollars we will have to cut military personnel by two hundred and fifty thousand,Premise
civilian personnel by a hundred thousand,Premise
jobs in america by a hundred thousand,Premise
if we can just tap the intelligence and ability the sound common sense and the good judgment of the american people we can once again have a foreign policy to make us proud instead of ashamed,Claim
we agreed to a mutual cap on the ballistic missile launchers at a ceiling of twentyfour hundred,Premise
if that becomes a permanent agreement will have to make a reduction in their launchers that they now have or plan to have,Claim
iran has been a good ally,Premise
that communique calls for the normalization of relations between the united states and the peoples republic,Claim
governor carter apparently doesnt know the facts,Premise
it would not interfere with our own program,Premise
i intend to do so,Claim
i would continue to negotiate with the panamanians,Premise
those who sit in washington eighteen months after the incident are not the best judges of the decisionmaking process that had to be made by the national security council and by myself at the time the incident was developing in the pacific,Premise
the white house made no attempt to block the issuing of that report,Claim
it wouldve prevented the boycott from continuing,Claim
this is something that we can do,Claim
the congress failed to do it,Premise
we intend to do it,Claim
i will never uh  go along with the admission of vietnam to the united nations,Claim
i believe that the american people in the next four years under a ford administration will be called upon to make those necessary sacrifices to preserve the peace which we have,Claim
we will have to maintain an adequate military capability,Premise
we will have to add a uh  i think uh  a few billion dollars to our defense appropriations,Claim
to make certain that we have adequate uh strategic forces  adequate conventional forces,Premise
i dont think that uh  america can go on a big spending spree with a whole lot of new programs uh  that would add significantly to the federal budget,Claim
i believe that the american people would be willing to give this thrust to preserve the peace and the necessary restraint at home to hold the lid on spending so that we could i think have a long overdue and totally justified tax decrease for the middleincome people,Claim
if given the leadership that i would expect to give,Premise
i think the american people would be willing to make those sacrifices for peace and prosperity in the next uh  four years,Claim
with the economy that would be generated from a restraint on spending,Premise
and a tax uh reduction primarily for the middleincome people,Premise
i think the american people will be called upon to uh  uh  be in the forefront in giving leadership to the solution of those problems that must be solved in the middle east in southern africa and any problems that might arise in the pacific,Claim
the american people will be called upon to tighten their belts a bit in meeting some of the problems that we face domestically,Claim
were going to have a fairly high rate of unemployment over a fairly long time,Claim
growth is gonna be fairly slow,Claim
were not gonna be able to do much  very much in the next four or five years to meet the basic agenda of our national needs in the cities in health uh in transit and a whole lot of things like that,Claim
no,Claim
i believe we can meet the problems within the cities of this country and still uh  give a tax reduction,Claim
i proposed as you know a reduction to increase the personal exemption from seven hundred and fifty to a thousand dollars,Premise
with the fiscal program that i have and if you look at the projections it shows that we will reduce unemployment,Premise
that we will continue to win the battle against inflation,Premise
at the same time give the kind of quality of life that i believe is possible in america,Premise
a job a home for all those thatll work and save for it uh  safety in the streets uh  health that is a  health care that is affordable,Premise
these things can be done,Claim
if we have the right vision and the right restraint and the right leadership,Premise
were spending very significant amounts of money now some 200 billion a year almost 50 percent of our total federal expenditure uh  by the federal government at the present time for human needs,Premise
we will probably need to increase that to same extent,Claim
we dont have to have  growth in spending that will blow the lid off and add to the problems of inflation,Claim
i think in case of the carter administration the sacrifices would be much less,Claim
mr fords own uh  environmental agency has projected a 10 percent unemployment rate by 1978 if hes uh  president,Premise
the american people are ready to make sacrifices,Claim
if they are part of the process,Premise
if they know that they will be helping to make decisions and wont be excluded from being an involved party to the national purpose,Premise
the major effort we must put forward is to put our people back to work,Claim
i think that this uh  is one example where uh  a lot of people have selfish grasping ideas now,Claim
i remember 1973 in the depth of the uh  energy crisis when president nixon called on the american people to make a sacrifice to cut down on the waste of uh  gasoline to cut down on the uh  speed of automobiles,Premise
it was a  a tremendous surge of patriotism that i want to make a sacrifice for my country,Premise
i think we uh  could call together with strong leadership in the white house business industry and labor and say lets have voluntary price restraints,Claim
i know im ready for it,Claim
i think the american people are too,Claim
i think uh  uh  a balanced approach with everybody being part of it and a striving for unselfishness could help as it did in 1973 to let people sacrifice for their own country,Claim
lets lay down some guidelines so we dont have continuing inflation,Claim
the person who has to pay that expense is the middleincome family,Claim
whos still working for a living and they have to pay for the rich who have privilege and for the poor who are not working,Premise
both those extremes grasp for advantage,Premise
we can also have a an end to the extremes,Claim
we now have one extreme for instance of some welfare recipients who by taking advantage of the welfare laws the housing laws the uh  medicaid uh  laws and the uh  food stamp laws make over 10 thousand a year and uh  they dont have to pay any taxes on it,Premise
at the other extreme uh  just 1 percent of the richest people in our country derive 25 percent of all the tax benefits,Premise
voters are so turned off by this election campaign so far that only half intend to vote,Claim
one major reason for this apathetic electorate appears to be the low level at which this campaign has been conducted,Premise
it has digressed frequently from important issues into allegations of blunder and brainwashing and fixations on lust and playboy,Premise
i think the major reason for a decrease in participation that we have experienced ever since 1960 has been the deep discouragement of the american people about the performance of public officials,Claim
when youve got seven and a half eight million people out of work,Premise
youve got three times as much inflation as you had during the last eightyear democratic administration,Premise
when you have the highest deficits in history,Premise
when you have it uh  becoming increasingly difficult far a family to put a child through college or to own a home theres a natural inclination to be turned off,Premise
ive made some mistakes,Claim
in the aftermath of vietnam and cambodia and uh  watergate and uh  the cia revelations people have feel  have felt that theyve uh been betrayed by public officials,Premise
ive been in thirty primaries during the springtime,Premise
ive been campaigning for twentytwo months,Premise
this is uh  uh  part of uh  of just being a human being,Premise
im doing the best i can to get away from that,Claim
during the next ten days the american people will not see the carter campaign running uh  television advertisements and newspaper advertisements based on a personal attack on president fords character,Claim
in retrospect from hindsight i would not have given that uh  interview had i do it  had it  i to do it over again,Claim
the playboy thing has been of great  very great concern to me,Premise
i dont know how to deal with it exactly,Premise
i uh  agreed to give the interview uh  to playboy,Premise
other people have done it who are notable  uh  governor jerry brown uh  walter cronkite uh  albert schweitzer mr fords own secretary of the treasury mr simon uh  william buckley  many other people,Premise
they werent running for president,Premise
ill use another forum besides playboy,Claim
if i should ever decide in the future to discuss my  my deep christian beliefs and uh  condemnation and sinfulness,Premise
i hope that we can leave those issues in this next ten days about personalities and mistakes of the past  weve both made some mistakes  and talk about unemployment inflation housing education taxation government organization stripping away of secrecy and the things that are crucial to the american people,Claim
i regret the things in my own long campaign that have been mistaken,Premise
im trying to do away with those the last ten days,Claim
i believe that the uh  american people have been turned off in this election uh  mr maynard for a variety of reasons,Claim
we have seen on capitol hill in the congress uh  a great many uh  allegations of wrongdoing of uh  alleged immorality,Premise
those are very disturbing to the american people,Premise
they wonder how an elected representative uh  can serve them and participate in such activities uh  serving in the congress of the united states,Premise
im certain many many americans were turned off by the revelations of watergate,Claim
a very very uh  bad period of time in american political history,Premise
thousands maybe millions of americans were turned off,Claim
because of the uh  problems that came out of our involvement in vietnam,Premise
i found on july fourth of this year a new spirit born in america,Claim
we were celebrating our bicentennial,Premise
there is a  a movement as i travel around the country of greater interest in this campaign,Premise
i think this election is one of the mast vital in the history of america,Claim
i do make a pledge that in the next ten days when were asking the american people to make one of the most important decisions in their lifetime that uh  we do together what we can to stimulate voter participation,Claim
im guilty of that just like i think most others in the political arena,Claim
like uh  any hardworking uh  person seeking public office uh  in the campaign inevitably sometimes you will use uh  rather graphic language,Premise
i think the matter is closed once and for all,Claim
i dont control any of the tapes,Claim
those tapes are in the jurisdiction of the courts and i have no right to say yes or no,Premise
i think the matter is settled once and for all,Claim
all the committees the attorney general the special prosecutor all of them have given me a clean bill of health,Premise
i testified before two committees house and senate on precisely the questions that you have asked,Premise
the testimony under oath was to the effect that i did not talk to mr nixon to mr haldeman to mr ehrlichman or to any of the people at the white house,Premise
i said i had no recollection whatsoever of talking with any of the white house legislative liaison people,Premise
i indicated under oath that the initiative that i took was at the request of the ranking members of the house banking and currency committee on the republican side,Premise
which was a legitimate request and a proper response by me,Premise
that was gone into by two congressional committees,Premise
following that investigation both committees overwhelmingly approved me,Premise
the house and the senate did likewise,Premise
in the meantime the special prosecutor within the last few days after an investigation himself said there was no reason for him to get involved because he found nothing that would justify it,Premise
just a day or two ago the attorney general of the united states made a further investigation and came to precisely the same conclusion,Premise
after all of those investigations by objective responsible people,Premise
i think that you still have not gone into details about what your role in it was,Claim
there is any question about whether or not uh  there was criminal prosecution but whether  whether you have told the american people your entire involvement in it,Premise
whether you would be willing even if you dont control the tapes whether you would be willing to ask that the tapes be released for examination,Premise
thats for the uh  proper authorities who have control over those tapes to make that decision,Claim
ive told everything i know about it,Claim
i think the matter is settled once and for all,Claim
i have given every bit of evidence answered every question thats as been asked me by any senator or any member of the house,Premise
plus the fact that the special prosecutor on his own initiation and the attorney general on his initiation the highest law enforcement official in this country all of them have given me a clean bill of health,Premise
the next big crisis spot in the world may be yugoslavia,Claim
president tito is old and sick and there are divisions in his country,Premise
its pretty certain that the russians are gonna do everything they possibly can after tito dies to force yugoslavia back into the soviet camp,Premise
i think its accurate to say that there is no uh  prospect in their opinion of the soviet union invading uh  yugoslavia should uh  mr tito pass away,Claim
in the last uh  two weeks ive had a chance to talk to uh  two men who have visited uh  the soviet union yugoslavia and china,Premise
one is governor avell averell harriman who visited the soviet union and yugoslavia,Premise
the other is james schlesinger whom i think you accompanied to uh  china,Premise
mr harriman talked to the leaders in yugoslavia,Premise
i got a a complete report back from those countries from these two distinguished  uh  gentlemen,Premise
the present leadership uh  there is uh  is fairly uniform in  in their purpose,Premise
i think it would be unwise for us to say that we will go to war uh  in yugoslavia uh  if the soviets should invade,Claim
which i think would be an extremely unlikely thing,Claim
i would never uh  go to war or become militarily involved in the internal affairs of another country unless our own security was direc rectly threatened,Claim
i have maintained from the very beginning of my campaign,Premise
this was a standard answer that i made in response to the yugoslavian question,Premise
i dont believe that our security would be directly threatened if the soviet union went uh  into yugoslavia,Claim
i dont believe it will happen,Claim
i would take eh  the strongest possible measures short of uh  actual military uh  action there by our own troops,Premise
i doubt that that would be an eventuality,Claim
i firmly believe uh  mr kraft that its unwise for a president to signal in advance what uh  options he might exercise if any uhh  international problem arose,Claim
we all recall with some sadness that at uh  the period of the nin late nineteen forties early nineteen fifties there were some indications that the united states would not include uh  south korea in an area of defense,Premise
there are some who allege i cant prove it true or untrue that uh  such a statement uh  in effect invited the north koreans to invade south korea,Premise
its a fact they did,Premise
no president of the united states in my opinion should signal in advance to a prospective enemy what his uhh  decision might be or what option he might exercise,Claim
its far better for a person sitting in the white house uh  who has a number of options to make certain that the uh  other side so to speak doesnt know precisely what youre going to do,Premise
that was the reason that i would not uh  identify any particular course of action uh  when i responded to a question a week or so ago,Premise
i think in the fact that he apologized that he was reprimanded uh  does permit him to stay on and continue that kind of leadership thats we so badly need,Claim
as we enter into uh  negotiations uh  under the salt ii agreement,Premise
if we have operations that might be developing uh in the middle east or southern africa in the pacific,Premise
we need a man with that experience that knowledge that knowhow,Claim
i think in light of the fact that he has uh  apologized uh  would not have justified my asking for his resignation,Claim
i think that will uh  in this situation settle the matter,Claim
i have indicated to general brown that uh  the words that he used in that interview in that particular case and in several others were very ill advised,Premise
general brown has indicated uh  his apology his regrets,Premise
general brown has an exemply sic record of military performance,Claim
he served this nation with great great skill and courage and bravery for thirtyfive years,Premise
its the consensus of the people who are knowledgeable in the military field that he is probably the outstanding military leader and strategist that we have in america today,Premise
i think the only criticism that i would have uh  on  of mr ford is that uh  immediately when the statement was re  re  revealed uh  perhaps a  a statement from the president would have been a clarifying and a very beneficial thing,Claim
i think this is uh  the second time that general brown has made a statement that  for which he did have to apologize,Premise
i know that everybody uh  makes mistakes,Premise
the first one was related to uh  the unwarranted influence of american jews on the media and uh  in the congress,Premise
this one concerned uh  great britain,Premise
he said that israel was a  a military burden on us and that iran hoped to reestablish the persian empire,Premise
im not uh  sure that i remembered earlier that president ford had  had expressed uh  his concern about the statement or apologized for it,Premise
something though that i think uh  is indicative of the need among the american people to know how its commanderinchief the president feels,Claim
many americans uh  still seem to be uneasy about you,Claim
they dont feel that uh  they know you or the people around you,Premise
you havent reached out to bring people of broad background or national experience into your campaign or your presidential plans,Premise
most of the people around you on a daytoday basis are the people youve kno known in georgia,Premise
many of them are young and relatively inexperienced in national affairs,Premise
i dont believe it does,Claim
i began campaigning uh  twentytwo months ago,Premise
at that time nobody thought i had a chance to win,Premise
very few people knew who i was,Premise
i think this should be indicative of the kind of leaders i would choose to help me,Claim
if i am elected,Premise
i chose senator walter mondale,Premise
the only criterion i ever put forward in my own mind was who among the several million people in this country would be the best person qualified to be president,Claim
if something should happen to me,Premise
to join me in being vice president,Claim
if i should serve out my term,Premise
i believe this is a good indication of the kind of people i would choose in the future,Claim
i think this is indicative of what i would do,Claim
walter mondale was the right choice,Claim
i came from a tiny town as you know plains,Premise
didnt hold public office,Premise
didnt have very much money,Premise
my first organization was just four or five people plus my wife and my children my three sons and their wives,Premise
we won the nomination by going out into the streets  barbershops beauty parlors restaurants stores in factory shift lines also in farmers markets and livestock sale barns,Premise
we talked a lot and we listened a lot and we learned from the american people,Premise
we built up uh  an awareness among the uh  voters of this country particularly those in whose primaries i entered  thirty of them nobodys ever done that before  about who i was and what i stood for,Premise
now we have a very very wideranging group of advisers who help me prepare for these debates and who teach me about international economics and foreign affairs defense matters health education welfare government reorganization,Premise
id say several hundred of them,Premise
theyre very fine and very highly qualified,Premise
i feel completely at ease knowing that someday senator mondale might very well be president,Premise
in the last five pres vice presidential uh  nominees uh  incumbents three of them have become president,Premise
it was a wellestablished criteria that the person i selected would be fully qualified to be president of the united states,Claim
senator bob dole is so qualified,Claim
sixteen years in the house of representatives and in the senate,Premise
very high responsibilities on important committees,Premise
i dont think thats a proper way to describe aayuh chairman of the joint chiefs of staff who has fought for his country for thirtyfive years,Claim
i think senator dole would show more good judgment and discretion than to so describe uh  a heroic and brave and very outstanding leader of the military,Claim
i think our selection uh  of bob dole as vice president uh  is based on merit,Claim
i think he would do an outstanding job as president of the united states,Claim
if he should ever become uh  the president of the united states,Premise
with his vast experience as member the house and a member of the senate as well as a vice president,Premise
i was uh  very very surprised when i read that uh  senator mondale made a very derogatory very personal comment about general brown uh  after the news story that uh  broke about general brown,Premise
if my recollection is correct he indicated that uh  general brown was not qualified to be a sewer commissioner,Premise
i vetoed the stripmining bill,Claim
it was the overwhelming consensus of knowledgeable people that that stripmining bill would have meant the loss of literally uh  thousands of jobs something around a hundred and forty thousand jabs,Premise
that stripmining bill wouldve severely set back our need for more coal,Premise
governor carter has said repeatedly that coal is the resource that we need to use more in the effort to become independent of the uh  arab oil supply,Premise
i vetoed it,Claim
because of a loss of jobs,Premise
it wouldve interfered with our energy independence program,Premise
i think the league of conservation voters is absolutely right,Claim
lets talk about what the ford administration has done in the field of environment,Claim
i have increased as president by over 60 percent the funding for water treatment plants in the united states the federal contribution,Premise
i have fully funded the land and water conservation program,Premise
in fact have recommended and the congress approved a substantially increased land and water conservation program,Premise
i have uh  added in the current year budget the funds for the national park service,Premise
for example we uh  proposed about 12 million to add between four and five hundred more employees for the national park service,Premise
a month or so ago i did uh  likewise say over the next ten years we should expand  double  this national parks the wild wilderness areas the scenic river areas,Premise
the  the final thing is that i have signed and approved of more scenic rivers more wilderness areas since ive been president than any other president in the history of the united states,Premise
this uh  administrations record on environment is very bad,Claim
i think its accurate to say that the uh  stripmining law which was passed twice by the congress  uh  and was only like two votes i believe of being overridden  would have been good for the country,Claim
the claim that it would have put hundred and forty thousand miners out of work is uh  hard to believe,Claim
at the time mr ford vetoed it the united mine workers was uh  supporting the bill,Premise
i dont think they would have supported the uh  bill had they known that they would lose a hundred and forty thousand jobs,Premise
theres been a consistent policy on the part of this administration to lower or delay enforcement of air pollution standards and water pollution standards,Premise
under both president nixon and ford monies have been impounded that wouldve gone to uh  cities and others to control uh  water pollution,Premise
we have no energy policy,Premise
we i think are the only developed nation in the world that has no comprehensive energy policy to permit us to plan in an orderly way how to shift from increasing the scarce uh  energy uh  forms oil and have research and development concentrated on the increased use of coal which i strongly favor,Claim
the research and development to be used primary to make the coal burning uh  be clean,Claim
we need a heritage trust program,Claim
similar to the one we had in georgia,Premise
to set aside additional lands that have uh  geological and archeological importance uh natural areas for enjoyment,Premise
this administration having been in office now for two years or more has still not taken strong and bold action to stop the proliferation of nuclear waste around the world particularly plutonium,Premise
those are some brief remarks about the failures of this administration,Premise
i would do the opposite in every respect,Claim
the lands that mr ford uh  brags about having approved are in alaska and they are enormous in uh  in size,Premise
as far as the accessibility of them by the american people its very uh  far in the future,Premise
weve taken no strong position in the uh  control of pollution of our oceans,Premise
i would say the worst uh  threat to the environment of all is nuclear proliferation,Premise
this administration has no urban policy,Claim
its impossible for mayors or governors to cooperate with the resident,Claim
they cant anticipate whats gonna happen next,Premise
a mayor of a city like new york for instance needs to know uh  eighteen months or two years ahead of time what responsibility the city will have in administration and in financing  in things like housing uh  pollution control uh  crime control education welfare and health,Premise
this has not been done unfortunately,Premise
i think its very important that our cities know that they have a partner in the federal government,Claim
i remember the headline in the daily news that said ford to new york drop dead,Premise
i favor all revenue sharing money being used for local governments and also to remove prohibitions in the use of revenue sharing money so that it can be used to improve education and health care,Claim
the major  uh thrust has gotta be to put people back to work,Claim
weve got an extraordinarily high unemployment rate among downtown urban ghetto areas uh  particularly among the very poor and particularly among minority groups sometimes 50 or 60 percent,Premise
the concentration of employment opportunities in those areas would help greatly not only to reestablish the tax base but also to help reduce the extraordinary welfare cost,Premise
we have now uh  for instance only 7 percent of the total education cost being financed by the federal government,Premise
when uh  the nixonford administration started this was 10 percent,Premise
thats a 30 percent reduction in the portion that the federal government contributes to education in just eight years,Premise
the education cost has gone up uh  tremendously,Premise
quite often congress has passed laws in the past designed to help people with uh  the ownership of homes and with the control of crime and with adequate health care and education programs and so forth,Premise
those uh programs were designed to help those who need it most,Premise
quite often this has been in the very poor people and neighborhoods in the downtown urban centers,Premise
because of the uh  great ly greatly uh  advantaged uh  tho per  persons who live in the suburbs better education better organization more articulate more aware of what the laws are quite often this money has been channeled out of the downtown centers where its needed,Premise
one of the major responsibilities on the shoulders of uh  new york city is to  is to finance welfare,Premise
i favor a shifting of the welfare cost away from the local governments altogether,Claim
over a longer period of time let the federal government begin to absorb part of it thats now paid by the state governments,Claim

study after study has shown little progress in desegregation and in fact actual increases in segregated schools and housing in the northeast,Premise
civil rights groups have complained repeatedly that theres been lack of progress and commitment to an integrated society uh  during your administration,Premise
im very proud of the record of this administration,Claim
in the cabinet i have one of the outstanding i think administrators as the secretary of transportation bill coleman,Premise
youre familiar im sure with the recognition given in the air force to uh  general james,Premise
there was just uh  approved a threestar admiral the first in the history of the united states navy so uh  we are giving full recognition to individuals of quality in the ford administration in positions of great responsibility,Premise

the office of small business under mr kobelinski has a very massive program trying to help the black community,Premise
the individual who wants to start a business or expand his business as a black businessman is able to borrow either directly or with guaranteed loans,Premise
i believe on the record that this administration has been more responsive and we have carried out the law to the letter,Claim
im proud of the record,Claim
the uh  description just made of this administrations record is hard to uh  recognize,Claim
mr ford voted against the uh  voting rights acts and the uh  civil rights acts in their uh  debative stage,Premise
once it was assured they were going to pass he finally voted for it,Premise
this country uh  changed drastically in 1969,Claim
when the uh  terms of john kennedy and lyndon johnson were over and richard nixon and  and gerald ford became the presidents,Premise
there was a time when there was hope for those who uh  were poor and downtrodden and who were  uh elderly or who were  uh ill or who were in minority groups,Premise
that time has been gone,Premise
i think the greatest thing that ever happened to the south was the passage of the civil rights act and the opening up of opportunities  uh to black people,Claim
the chance to vote,Premise
to hold a job,Premise
to buy a house,Premise
to go to school,Premise
to participate in public affairs,Premise
it not only liberated  uh black people but it also liberated the whites,Premise
the bankruptcies have gone up  uh in an extraordinary degree,Claim
weve seen uh  in many instances in recent years a minority affairs uh  section of uh small loan administration uh  small business administration lend uh  a black entrepreneur just enough money to get started and then to go bankrupt,Premise
fha which used to be a very responsible agency uh  that everyone looked to to help own a home lost six million dollars last year,Premise
thereve been over thirteen hundred indictments in hud,Premise
over eight hundred convictions relating just to home loans,Premise
now the federal government has become the worlds greatest slum landlord,Claim
thats been lacking in the last eight years,Claim
it requires an aggressive searching out and reaching out to help people who especially need it,Claim
it doesnt take just a quiet uh  dormant uh minimum enforcement of the law,Claim
weve got a 30 percent or 40 percent unemployment rate among minority uh  young people,Premise
theres been no concerted effort given to the needs of those who are both poor and black or poor and who speak a foreign language,Premise
thats where theres been a great uh generation of despair and ill health,Premise
the lack of education,Premise
lack of purposefulness,Premise
the lack of hope for the future,Premise
i would not work hard to support any of those,Claim
im strongly against a abortion,Claim
i think abortions wrong,Claim
i dont think the government oughta do anything to encourage abortion,Claim
i dont favor a constitutional amendment on the subject,Claim
ill do everything i can to minimize the need for abortions,Claim
better sex education family planning,Premise
better adoptive procedures,Premise
i personally dont believe that the federal government oughta finance abortions,Claim
i draw the line and dont support a constitutional amendment,Claim
i wont actively work for the passage of any of them,Claim
weve always had i think a lot of constitutional amendments proposed but the passage of them has been uh  fairly slow and uh  few and far between,Premise
in the twohundredyear history theres been a very uh  cautious approach to this,Premise
quite often we have a transient problem,Premise
support the uh  republican uh  platform which calls for the constitutional amendment that would uh  outlaw abortions,Claim
we ought to have a federal constitutional amendment that would permit each one of the fifty states to make the choice,Claim
if you really believe that the people of a state ought to make a decision on a matter of this kind,Premise
i think this is a responsible and a proper way to proceed,Claim
i believe also that uh  there is some merit to a  an amendment that uh  uh  senator everett dirksen uh  proposed very frequently an amendment that would uh  change the court decision as far as voluntary prayer in public schools,Claim
it seems to me that there should have  be an opportunity uh  as long as its voluntary as long as there is no uh  compulsion whatsoever that uh  an individual ought to have that right,Premise
in those two cases i think uh  such uh  a constitutional amendment would be proper,Claim
i really dont think in either case theyre trivial matters,Claim
theyre matters of very deep conviction as far as many many people in this country believe,Premise
i favor the particular constitutional amendment that would turn over to the states the uh  individual right to the voters in those states uh  the chance to make a decision by public referendum,Claim
they shouldnt be treated lightly,Claim
theyre matters that are ah  important,Premise
in those two cases i would favor them,Claim
what we have to do and this is the crux of the matter is to make it very very uh  difficult for a person who uses a gun in the commission of a crime to stay out of jail,Claim
i dont believe in the registration of handguns or the registration of the handgun owner,Claim
that has not proven to be effective,Premise
the record of gun control whether its one city or another or in some states does not show that the registration of a gun handgun or the registration of the gun owner has in any way whatsoever decreased the crime rate or the use of that gun in the committing of a crime,Premise
the record just doesnt prove that such legislation or action by a local city council is effective,Premise
in my opinion we are going after the person who uses the gun for the wrong reason,Claim
if we make the use of a gun in the commission of a crime a serious criminal offense and that person is prosecuted,Premise
i think the better way is to go after the criminal the individual who commits a crime in the possession of a gun and uses that gun for a part of his criminal activity,Claim
those are the people who ought to be in jai,Premise
the only way to do it is to pass strong legislation so that once apprehended indicted convicted theyll be in jail and off the streets and not using guns in the commission of a crime,Claim
a national registration of handguns or handgun owners will solve the problem youre talking about,Claim
the person who wants to use a gun for an illegal purpose can get it whether its registered or outlawed,Premise
they will be obtained,Premise
they are the people who ought to go behind bars,Premise
you should not in the process penalize the legitimate handgun owner,Claim
when you go through the process of registration you in effect are penalizing that individual who uses his gun for a very legitimate purpose,Premise
i think its accurate to say that mr fords position on gun control has changed,Claim
earlier uh  mr levi his uh  attorney general put forward a gun control proposal which mr ford later i believe espoused that called for the prohibition against the uh sale aw of the uh  socalled saturday night specials,Premise
it wouldve put uh  very strict uh  uh  control over who owned a handgun,Premise
i believe that limited approach to the  to the question would be uh  advisable and  and i think adequate,Claim
i have been a hunter all my life and happen to own both shotguns rifles and a handgun,Premise
the only purpose that i would see in registering uh  handguns and not long guns of any kind would be to prohibit the uh  ownership of those guns by those whove used them in the commission of a crime or who uh  have been proven to be mentally incompetent to own a gun,Premise
thats as far as i would go with it,Claim
merit selection of judges is the most important single criterion,Claim
i would institute the same kind of procedure as president not only in judicial appointments but also in diplomatic appointments,Claim
while i was governor of georgia although im not a lawyer we had complete reform of the georgia court system,Premise
we uh  streamlined the structure of the court,Premise
put in administrative officers,Premise
put a unified court system in,Premise
required that all uh  severe sentences be reviewed far uniformity,Premise
in addition to that put forward a proposal that was adopted and used throughout my own term of office of selection of  for all judges and district attorneys or prosecuting attorneys on the basis of merit,Premise
every time i had a vacancy on the georgia supreme court  and i filled five of those vacancies out of seven total and about half the court of appeals judges about 35 percent of the trial judges  i was given from an objective panel the five most highly qualified persons in georgia,Premise
from those five i always chose the first one or second one,Premise
i think that the burger court has fairly well confirmed the major and  and most farreaching and most controversial decisions of the warren court,Claim
civil rights  uh has been confirmed by the burger court hasnt been uh  reversed,Premise
i dont think theres any inclination to reverse those basic decisions,Premise
i think the burger court has confirmed that basic and very controversial decision of the warren court,Claim
the oneman onevote rule which is a very important one that uh  s struck down the unwarranted influence in the legislature of parsley  uh populated areas of  of the states,Premise
the uh  right of indigent or very poor accused persons to uh  legal counsel,Premise
i answered it by saying that it would be on the basis of merit,Claim
once the uh  search and analysis procedure had been completed and once im given a list of the five or seven or ten uh  best qualified persons in the country i would make a selection from among those uh  persons,Premise
i would undoubtedly choose someone who would most accurately reflect my own basic politi political philosophy as best i could determine it,Claim
if the uh  list was uh  in my opinion fairly uniform,Premise
if there was no outstanding person,Premise
to continue the progress that has been made under the last two uh  courts  the warren court and the burger court,Claim
i would also like to uh  completely revise our criminal justice system,Claim
do some of the things at the federal level in court reform that ive just described as has been done in georgia and other states,Claim
i would like to appoint people who would be interested in helping with that,Claim
i know that uh chief justice burger is,Premise
he hasnt had help from the administration from the congress to carry this out,Premise
the uh  emphasis i think of the  of the court system uh  should be to interpret the uh  the constitution and the laws uh  equally between property protection and personal protection,Claim
i think the choice should be with human rights,Claim
when theres uh  a very narrow decision  which quite often theres one that reaches the supreme court,Premise
that would be another factor that i would follow,Claim
i think the answer uh  as to the kind of person that i would select uh  is obvious,Claim
i had one opportunity to nominate uh  an individual to the supreme court and i selected the circuit court of appeals judge from illinois uh  john paul stevens,Premise
i selected him,Claim
because of his outstanding record as a circuit court of appeals judge,Premise
i was very pleased that uh  an overwhelming democratic united states senate after going into his background came to the conclusion that he was uh  fit and should serve and the vote in his behalf was overwhelming,Premise
i would say somebody in the format of uh  justice stevens would be the kind of an individual that i would uh  select in the future,Claim
as i did him in the past,Premise
i believe that the sale of uh  saturday night s specials should be cut out,Claim
i violently disagree with your assessment,Claim
i dont think the record justifies the conclusion that you come to,Claim
the american buyer is getting a better bargain today,Claim
inflation is less,Premise
let me uh  talk about uh  the economic announcements that were made just this past week,Premise
it was announced that the uh  gnp real growth in the third quarter was at 4 percent,Premise
over the last ten years thats a higher figure than the average growth during that tenyear period,Premise
its lower than the ninepointpointtwo percent growth in the first quarter,Premise
its lower than the uh 5 percent growth in the second quarter,Premise
every economist  liberal conservative that im familiar with  recognizes that in the fourth quarter of this year and in the fifth quar uh  the first quarter of next year that well have an increase in real gnp,Premise

we had an 18 percent increase in housing starts,Premise
we had a substantial increase in new permits for housing,Premise
based on the announcement this week there will be at an annual rate of a million eight hundred and some thousand new houses built,Premise
which is a tremendous increase over last year and a substantial increase over the earlier part of this year,Premise
in addition we had a very  some very good news in the reduction in the rate of inflation,Premise
the rate of inflation as announced just the other day is under 5 percent,Premise
the uh  44 percent that was indicated at the time of the 4 percent gnp was less than the 54 percent,Premise
there has been an increase in layoffs and thats something that bothers everybody,Claim

there will be more industrial activity,Claim
there will be a reduction in the uhh  unemployment,Claim
there will be increased hires,Claim
there will be increased employment,Claim
most economists regardless of their political philosophy uh  indicate that this pause for a month or two was healthy because we could not have honestly sustained a 92 percent rate of growth which we had in the first quarter of this year,Premise
the united states is leading the free world out of the recession that was serious a year year and a half ago,Claim
the united states economic recovery from the recession of a year ago is well ahead of the economic recovery of any major free industrial nation in the world today,Premise
were ahead of all of the western european country,Premise
were ahead of japan,Premise
were going to see unemployment going down,Claim

since hes been in office two and a half million more american people have lost their jobs,Premise
in the last four months alone five hundred thousand americans have gone on the unemployment roll,Premise
in the last month weve had a net loss of one hundred and sixtythree thousand jobs,Premise
inflation is robbing us,Claim
savings accounts are losing money instead of gaining money,Premise
anybody who says that the inflation rate is in good shape now ought to talk to the housewives,Claim
one of the overwhelming results that ive seen in the polls is that people feel that you cant plan anymore,Premise
theres no way to make a prediction that my family might be able to own a home or to put my kid through college,Premise
i think this shows a callous indifference to the families that have suffered so much,Claim
i dont blame him,Claim
in 1975 we had fewer housing starts in this country fewer homes built than any year since 1940,Premise
he has vetoed bills passed by congress within the congressional budget guidelines job opportunities for two million americans,Premise
well never have a balanced budget,Claim
well never meet the needs of our people,Claim
well never control the inflationary spiral,Claim
as long as we have seven and a half or eight million people out of work who are looking for jobs,Premise
weve probably got two and a half more million people who are not looking for jobs any more,Claim
theyve given up hope,Premise
that is a very serious indictment of this administration,Claim
its probably the worst one of all,Claim
thats thirtyfive years,Premise
weve got a 35 percent unemployment rate in many areas of this country among construction workers,Premise
mr ford hasnt done anything about it,Premise
under the present administration  nixons and fords  weve had three times the inflation rate that we experienced under president johnson and president kennedy,Premise
the economic growth is less than half today what it was at the beginning of this year,Premise
housing starts  he compares the housing starts with last year,Premise
thats not exactly an accurate description of what happened,Claim
when i was that far ahead it was immediately following the democratic convention and before the republican convention,Premise
at that time uh  25 or 30 percent of the reagan supporters said that they would not support president ford,Premise
but as occurred at the end of the con democratic convention the republican party unified itself,Premise
immediately following the republican convention there was about a tenpoint spread,Premise
to be accurate i had 49 percent president ford 39 percent,Premise
the polls uh  are good indications of fluctuations but they vary widely one from another,Premise

in georgia alone for instance i got 84 percent of the vote,Premise

thats an overwhelming support from my own people who know me best,Premise
today we have about five hundred georgians at their own expense  just working people who believe in me  spread around the country uh  involved in the political campaign,Premise
i think a lot of it uh  depends on current events  uh  sometimes foreign affairs sometimes domestic affairs,Claim
i think our hold uh  of support among those who uh  are crucial to the election has been fairly steady,Claim
my success in the primary season was i think notable for a newcomer from someone whos from outside washington who  who never has been a part of the washington establishment,Claim
i think that well have good results uh  on november the second for myself and i hope for the country,Claim
i think uh  the uh  increase and the uh  prospects as far as im concerned and the i  less favorable prospects for governor carter reflect that governor carter uh  is inconsistent in many of the positions that he takes,Claim
he tends to distort on a number of occasions,Claim
just a moment ago for example uh  he uh  was indicating that uh  uh  in the 1950s for example uh  unemployment was very low,Premise
he fails to point out that uh  in the 1950s we were engaged in the war in vietnam,Premise

were going to make sure that the american people know the truth about why we are using force and what the explanation for it is,Claim
were at 200 billion and counting,Claim
the first gulf war cost america 5 billion,Premise
were also going to make sure that we tell the world the truth,Claim
its not just the american people,Premise
the reality is for america to lead for america to do what its done for 50 years before this president and vice president came into office it is critical that we be credible,Premise
it is critical that they believe that when america takes action they can trust what were doing,Claim
what we say what we say at the united nations what we say in direct conversations with leaders of the world,Premise

were having so much difficulty getting others involved in the effort in iraq,Claim
weve taken 90 percent of the coalition casualties,Premise
american taxpayers have borne 90 percent of the costs of the effort in iraq,Claim
the 90 percent figure is just dead wrong,Claim
120 billion is in fact what has been allocated to iraq,Claim
the enormous inconsistencies that john kerry and you have cited time after time after time during the course of the campaign,Premise
youre not credible on iraq,Claim
when you include the iraqi security forces that have suffered casualties as well as the allies theyve taken almost 50 percent of the casualties in operations in iraq,Claim
which leaves the us with 50 percent not 90 percent,Premise
it wasnt 200 billion,Claim
the rest of its for afghanistan and the global war on terror,Premise
your facts are just wrong,Claim
the allies have stepped forward and agreed to reduce and forgive iraqi debt to the tune of nearly 80 billion by one estimate,Premise

your rhetoric senator would be a lot more credible if there was a record to back it up,Premise
there isnt,Claim
prior to that by john kerry who has consistently come down on the wrong side of all the major defense issues that hes faced as a public official,Claim
you cannot use talk tough during the course of a 90minute debate in a presidential campaign to obscure a 30year record in the united states senate,Claim
i dont believe he has the qualities we need in a commander in chief,Claim
i dont think based on his record that he would pursue the kind of aggressive policies that need to be pursued if were going to defeat these terrorists,Premise
his judgments flawed,Claim
weve questioned is his judgment,Claim
if you look at his record he doesnt display the qualities of somebody who has conviction,Claim

we dont have to battle them here at home,Claim
the records there for anybody who wants to look at it,Premise
he opposed or called for the elimination of a great many major weapons systems that were crucial to winning the cold war and are important today to our overall forces,Premise
it in 1990 and 91 he stood up on the floor of the senate and voted against going in to liberate kuwait and push saddam hussein back to iraq,Premise
they in effect decided they would cast an antiwar vote and they voted against the troops,Claim
if they couldnt stand up to the pressures that howard dean represented how can we expect them to stand up to al qaida,Claim
weve seen a situation in which first they voted to commit the troops to send them to war,Premise
then they came back and when the question was whether or not you provide them with the resources they needed  body armor spare parts ammunition  they voted against it,Premise
what was happening was howard dean was making major progress in the democratic primaries running away with the primaries based on an antiwar record,Premise
a long resume does not equal good judgment,Claim
weve seen over and over and over the misjudgments made by this administration,Claim
its a continuation of the things hes been doing unfortunately on the campaign trail,Premise

were seeing the consequences of that everyday on the ground right now,Claim
we also thought it was wrong to have a 20 billion fund out of which 75 billion was going to go to a nobid contract for halliburton,Premise
i think the record speaks for itself,Claim
if we want to win the war on terror it seems to me its pretty clear the choice is george bush not john kerry,Claim
these are two individuals who have been for the war when the headlines were good and against it when their poll ratings were bad,Claim
we have not seen the kind of consistency that a commander in chief has to have in order to be a leader in wartime,Premise
in order to be able to see the strategy through to victory,Premise
john kerry has been absolutely clear and consistent from the beginning that we must stay focused on the people who attacked us,Claim

they cant be trained there,Claim
its so dangerous on the ground,Premise
we can take them out of iraq for purposes of training,Premise
the united nations which is responsible for the elections in january has about 35 people there,Premise
you need more than 35 people to hold an election in cleveland much less in iraq,Claim

i think would be exactly the right way to go,Claim
if they arent my guess is then the board of governors will recommend sending the whole matter to the un security council for the application of the international sanctions,Claim
what happens when we impose unilateral sanctions is unless theres a collective effort then other people move in and take advantage of the situation,Premise

we both believe that marriage is between a man and a woman,Claim
we also believe that gay and lesbians and gay and lesbian couples those who have been in longterm relationships deserve to be treated respectfully,Claim

those are not the kind of things that john kerry and i believe in,Claim
a gay couple now has a very difficult time,Claim
one visiting the other when theyre in the hospital or for example if heaven forbid one of them were to pass away they have trouble even arranging the funeral,Premise
we do believe that marriage should be between a man and a woman,Claim
the president is proposing a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage that is completely unnecessary,Claim
under the law of this country for the last 200 years no state has been required to recognize another states marriage,Premise

my concern is specifically with whats happened to our medical care system,Claim

i was in new mexico the other day and met with a group of obgyn docs,Premise
they were deeply concerned,Claim
they were fearful that thered be another increase in malpractice insurance rates as a result of what they believe are frivolous lawsuits and that that would put them out of business,Premise
we also think you need to limit the awards that the trial attorneys take out of all of this,Claim
we think this has a devastating impact on the quality of health care,Claim
my home state of wyoming weve lost the top insurer of malpractice insurance in the state,Premise
the rates for a general practitioner have gone from 40000 a year to 100000 a year for an insurance policy,Premise

we need to do is cap noneconomic damages,Claim
over 50 percent of the settlements go to the attorneys and for administrating overhead,Premise

not with the insurance companies,Premise
we dont believe that we should take away the right of people like valerie lakey,Claim
we do have too many lawsuits,Premise
the reality is theres something that we can do about it,Claim
we want to put more responsibility on the lawyers to require before a case malpractice,Claim
have the case reviewed by independent experts to determine if the case is serious and meritorious before it can be filed,Claim
hold the lawyers responsible for that certify that and hold the lawyer financially responsible if they dont do it,Claim
have a threestrikesandyoureout rule so that a lawyer who files three of these cases without meeting this requirement loses their right to file these cases,Claim
that way we keep the cases out of the system that dont belong in the system,Premise
it turns out the company knew of 12 other children who had either been killed or severely injured by the same problem,Premise
they hid it,Claim
they could have fixed it with a 2cent screw,Claim

i think is a very serious issue,Claim

it has to cover 25 percent of the cost of the program,Premise
its those kinds of loopholes that necessitate a premium increase under the law that was enacted in 1997,Claim
while you were in private practice in law and as a senator you had the advantage of a special tax loophole subchapter s corporation,Claim
you set up so you could avoid paying 600000 in medicare taxes that would have gone into the fund,Premise
the reason the money had to go into the trust fund was to make certain that we could cover those eligible for benefits,Claim
i have paid all the taxes that i owe,Premise
when the vice president was ceo of halliburton they took advantage of every offshore loophole available,Claim
they had multiple offshore companies that were avoiding taxes,Claim
those are the kind of things that ought to be closed,Premise
health care costs are going up every day for the american people,Claim
they ought to be closed whether they apply to a corporation,Claim

with respect to whats happening in africa and russia and in other places around the world the vice president spoke about the 15 billion for aids,Premise
the aids epidemic in africa,Claim

i think the important thing in picking a vice president probably varies from president to president,Claim
i think its worked in part,Claim
i made it clear that i dont have any further political aspirations myself,Premise
i think thats been an advantage,Claim
i think it allows the president to know that my only agenda is his agenda,Claim
i think from the perspective of the nation its worked in our relationship in this administration,Claim
i think that probably is the most important consideration in picking a vice president somebody who could take over,Claim
when george bush asked me to sign on it obviously wasnt because he was worried about carrying wyoming,Claim
he wanted me to do was to sign on because of my experience to be a member of the team to help him govern,Claim

we have to use extraordinary measures to deal with it,Claim
im a very strong advocate of a very aggressive policy of going after the terrorists and those who support terror,Claim
i feel very strongly that the significance of 911 cannot be underestimated,Claim
it forces us to think in new ways about strategy about national security about how we structure our forces and about how we use us military power,Claim
some people say we should wait until we are attacked before we use force,Premise
i would argue weve already been attacked,Claim
we lost more people on 911 than we lost at pearl harbor,Claim
mr vice president we were attacked,Claim

i dont know what the differences might be,Claim
i dont know what mr carters policies are,Premise

im a father of sons,Premise
i have a grandson,Premise
good management in preserving the peace requires that we control the events and try to intercept before they become a crisis,Premise
my tax cut does not come close to eliminating that 86 billion increase,Premise
im only reducing the amount of the increase,Premise
what im talking about is not putting government back to getting less money than governments been getting but simply cutting the increase in in spending,Claim
we can afford  along with the cuts that i have proposed in government spending  we can afford the tax cuts i have proposed,Claim
mr carters economic policy has built into the next five years and on beyond that a tax increase that will be taking 86 billion more out of the peoples pockets than was taken this year,Premise
i have submitted an economic plan that i have worked out in concert with a number of fine economists in this country all of whom approve it,Premise
believe that over a five year projection this plan can permit the extra spending for needed refurbishing of our defensive posture,Claim
it can provide for a balanced budget by 1983 if not earlier,Claim
i think im a much wiser and more experienced man than i was when i debated four years ago against president ford,Claim
ive had to make thousands of decisions since ive been president serving in the oval office,Premise
with each one of those decisions that affect the future of my country i have learned in the process,Premise
ive also learned that there are no simple answers to complicated questions,Claim
h l mencken said that for every problem theres a simple answer it would be neat and plausible and wrong,Premise
what weve done is use that enormous power and prestige and military strength of the united states to preserve the peace,Premise
weve not only kept peace for our own country but weve been able to extend the benefits of peace to others,Claim

this nation in the eight years before i became president had its own military strength decreased,Claim
seven out of eight years the budget commitments for defense went down 37 in all,Premise
since ive been in office weve had a steady carefully planned methodical but very effective increase in our commitment for defense,Claim
there are decisions that are made in the oval office by every president which are profound in nature,Claim
there are always trouble spots in the world and how those troubled areas are addressed by a president alone in that oval office affects our nation directly the involvement of the united states and also our american interests,Premise

we have made sure that we address this question peacefully,Claim
not injecting american military forces into combat,Premise
letting the strength of our nation be felt in a beneficial way,Premise
this i believe has assured that our interests will be protected in the persian gulf region as we have done in the middle east and throughout the world,Claim
i question the figure about the decline in defense spending under the two previous administrations in the preceding eight years to this administration,Claim
i would call to your attention that we were in a war that wound down during those eight years which of course made a change in military spending because of turning from war to peace,Premise
i also would like to point out that republican presidents in those years faced with a democratic majority in both houses of the congress found that their requests for defense budgets were very often cut,Premise
gerald ford left a fiveyear projected plan for a military buildup to restore our defenses,Premise
president carters administration reduced that by 38,Premise
cut 60 ships out of the navy building program that had been proposed,Premise
stopped the the bl,Premise
delayed the cruise missile,Premise
stopped the production line for the minuteman missile,Premise
stopped the trident or delayed the trident submarine,Premise

the buildup of military forces is good for our country,Claim
weve got to have military strength to preserve the peace,Premise
the best weapons are the ones that are never fired in combat,Premise
the best soldier is one who never has to lay his life down on the field of battle,Premise
strength is imperative for peace but the two must go hand in hand,Claim
there are various elements of defense,Claim
one is to control nuclear weapons,Premise
another one is how to address troubled areas of the world,Premise
yes,Claim
they have done very well,Claim
were importing today about onethird less oil from overseas than we did just a year ago,Premise
weve had a 25 reduction since the first year i was in office,Premise
we have added about nine million net new jobs in that period of time  a record never before achieved,Premise
increase in production of american energy which is going along very well,Claim
more coal this year than ever before in american history,Premise
more oil and gas wells drilled this year than ever before in history,Premise
the new economic revitalization program that we have in mind which will be implemented next year would result in tax credits,Claim
which would let business invest in new tools and new factories to create even more new jobs  about one million in the next two years,Claim
we also have planned a youth employment program which would encompass 600000 jobs for young people,Claim
during the past four years the consumer price index has risen from 48 to currently over 12,Premise
perhaps more significantly the nations broader underlying rate of inflation has gone up from 7 to 9,Premise
a part of that has been due to external factors beyond us control notably the more than doubling of opec oil prices last year,Claim
the united states remains vulnerable to such external shocks,Claim
he has blamed the people for inflation,Claim
opec he has blamed the federal reserve system,Premise
he has blamed the lack of productivity of the american people,Premise
he has then accused the people of living too well and that we must share in scarcity we must sacrifice and get used to doing with less,Premise
we dont have inflation because the people are living too well,Claim
we have inflation because the government is living too well,Claim
we will have a very poor nation and a very unsound economy,Claim
if we follow that path,Premise
i think this idea that has been spawned here in our country that inflation somehow came upon us like a plague and therefore its uncontrollable and no one can do anything about it is entirely spurious and its dangerous to say this to the people,Claim
when mr carter became president inflation was 48 as you said,Premise
it had been cut in two by president gerald ford,Premise
it is now running at 127,Premise
president carter also has spoken of the new jobs created,Premise
we always with the normal growth in our country and increase in population increase the number of jobs,Premise
that cant hide the fact that there are eight million men and women out of work in america today and two million of those lost their jobs in just the last few months,Premise
mr carter had also promised that he would not use unemployment as a tool to fight against inflation,Claim
his 1980 economic message stated that we would reduce productivity and gross national product and increase unemployment in order to get a handle on inflation because in january at the beginning of the year it was more than 18,Premise
my economic plan calls for that,Claim
you can lick inflation,Claim
by increasing productivity,Premise
by decreasing the cost of government to the place that we have balanced budgets and are no longer grinding out printing press money flooding the market with it because the government is spending more than it takes in,Premise
the presidents economic plan calls for increasing the taxes to the point that we finally take so much money away from the people that we can balance the budget in that way,Premise
i believe that there is enough extravagance and fat in government,Claim
one of the secretaries of hew under mr carter testified that he thought there was 7 billion worth of fraud and waste in welfare and in the medical programs associated with it,Premise
office estimate that there is probably tens of billions of dollars that is lost in fraud alone and they have added that waste adds even more to that,Premise
we have a program for a gradual reduction of government spending based on these theories,Premise
i have a task force now that has been working on where those cuts could be made,Premise
im confident that it can be done and that it will reduce inflation,Claim
i did it in california,Premise
inflation went down below the national average in california when we returned the money to the people and reduced government spending,Premise
governor reagans proposal the reagankemproth proposal is one of the most highly inflationary ideas that ever has been presented to the american public,Claim
he would actually have to cut government spending by at least 130 billion in order to balance the budget under this ridiculous proposal,Premise
i notice that his task force that is working for his future plans had some of their ideas revealed in the wall street journal this week,Premise
one of those ideas was to repeal the minimum wage,Premise
several times this year governor reagan has said that the major cause of unemployment is the minimum wage,Premise
this is a heartless kind of approach to the working families of our country,Claim
he more than doubled state spending while he was governor,Claim
122 increase  and had between a 20 and 30 increase in the number of employees,Premise
in california he had the three largest tax increases in the history of that state under his administration,Premise
the figures that the president has just used about california is a distortion of the situation there,Claim
while i was governor of california our spending in california increased less per capita than the spending in georgia while mr carter was governor of georgia in the same four years,Premise
the size of government increased only onesixth in california of what it increased in proportion to the population in georgia,Premise
i have been talking to a number of congressmen who have much the same idea that i have,Premise
in the inner city areas that in cooperation with the local government and the national government and using tax incentives and with cooperating with the private sector that we have development zones,Claim
let the local entity the city declare this particular area based on the standards of the percentage of people on welfare unemployed and so forth in that area,Premise
through tax incentives induce the creation of businesses providing jobs and so forth in those areas,Premise
for example a business that would not have for a period of time an increase in the property tax,Premise
its development of the unused property that it was making wouldnt be any loss to the city,Claim
the city isnt getting any tax from that now,Premise
there would simply be a delay,Premise
many of the people who would then be given jobs are presently wards of the government and it wouldnt hurt to give them a tax incentive,Claim
that wouldnt be costing government anything either,Premise
nothing has been done,Claim
i stood in the south bronx on the exact spot that president carter stood on in 1977,Premise
you have to see it to believe it,Premise
it looks like a bombedout city  great gaunt skeletons of buildings,Premise
windows smashed out,Premise
painted on one of them unkept promises on another despair,Premise
this was the spot at which president carter had promised that he was going to bring in a vast program to rebuild this department,Premise
there are whole or this area there are whole blocks of land that are left bare just bulldozed down flat,Premise
i think there are things to do in this regard,Claim
i believe in it,Claim
weve made great progress from the days when i was young and when this country didnt even know it had a racial problem,Premise
i am eternally optimistic,Premise
i believe the presidency is what teddy roosevelt said it was,Claim
its a bully pulpit,Claim
a goal for all of us should be that one day things will be done neither because of nor in spite of any of the differences between us  ethnic differences or racial differences whatever they may be  that we will have total equal opportunity for all people,Claim
i would do everything i could in my power to bring that about,Claim
this has been a very successful effort,Claim
we now are planning to continue the revitalization program with increased commitments of rapid transit mass transit,Claim
we also are pursuing housing programs,Claim
weve had such an increase in the number of people employed,Claim
of the nine million people put to work in new jobs since ive been in office 13 million of those has been among black americans and another million among those who speak spanish,Premise
under the windfall profits tax we expect to spend about 43 billion in the next 10 years to rebuild the transportation systems of our country,Premise
weve had a 73 increase in the allotment of federal funds for improved education,Premise
these are the kinds of efforts worked on a joint basis with community leaders particularly in the minority areas of the central cities that have been deteriorating so rapidly in the past,Premise
its very important to us that this be done with the full involvement of minority citizens,Claim
i have brought into the top level top levels of government into the white house into administrative offices of the executive branch into the judicial system highly qualified black and spanish citizens and women who in the past had been excluded,Premise
we still have a long way to go,Claim
we have gone a long way toward correcting these problems,Claim
ours is a nation of refugees a nation of immigrants,Claim
almost all of our citizens came here from other lands and now have hopes which are being realized for a better life preserving their ethnic commitments their family structures their religious beliefs preserving their relationships with their relatives in foreign countries,Premise
still holding themselves together in a very coherent society which gives our nation its strength,Premise
in the past those minority groups have often been excluded from participation in the affairs of government,Claim
since ive been president ive appointed for instance more than twice as many black federal judges as all previous presidents in the history of this country,Premise
ive done the same thing in the appointment of women and also spanishspeaking americans,Premise
to involve them in the administration of government and the feeling that they belong to the societal structure that makes decisions in the judiciary and in the executive branch is a very important commitment which i am trying to realize and will continue to do so in the future,Claim
as governor when i was at that end of the line and receiving some of these grants for government programs i saw that so many of them were deadend,Claim
they were public employment that these people who really want to get out into the private job market where there are jobs with a future,Premise
i have been in favor of a separate minimum for them,Claim
i wish he could have been with me when i sat with a group of teenagers who were black and who were telling me about their unemployment problems and that it was the minimum wage that had done away with the jobs that they once could get,Premise
indeed every time it has increased you will find there is an increase in minority unemployment among young people,Premise
with regard to the great progress that has been made with this government spending the rate of black unemployment in detroit michigan is 56,Premise
there is no doubt in my mind that the commitment to unemployment compensation the minimum wage welfare national health insurance those kinds of commitments that have typified the democratic party since ancient history in this countrys political life are a very important element of the future,Claim
its obvious that we still have a long way to go in fully incorporating the minority groups into the mainstream of american life,Premise
in all those elements governor reagan has repeatedly spoken out against them,Premise
which to me shows a very great insensitivity to giving deprived families a better chance in life,Claim
this to me is a very important difference between him and me in this election,Claim
this will give us an additional opportunity for jobs which will pay rich dividends,Claim
in the downtown central cities with the with the new commitment on an energy policy,Premise
with a chance to revitalize homes and to make them more fuel efficient,Premise
with a chance for our synthetic fuels program solar power,Premise
we committed ourselves to take strong action against terrorism,Claim
one of the blights on this world is the threat and the activities of terrorists,Claim
airplane hijacking was one of the elements of that commitment,Premise
in countries like libya or iraq we have even alienated some of our closest trade partners,Claim
we have insisted upon the control of the spread of nuclear weapons to those potentially terrorist countries,Premise
we have seen in recent years  in recent months  additional acts of violence against jews in france and of course against those who live in israel by the plo and other terrorist organizations,Premise
the most serious terrorist threat is if one of those radical nations who believe in terrorism as a policy should have atomic weapons,Claim
i and all my predecessors have had a deep commitment to controlling the proliferation of nuclear weapons,Premise
this ultimate terrorist threat is the most fearsome of all,Premise
its part of a pattern where our country must stand firm to control terrorism of all kinds,Claim
when governor reagan has been asked about that he makes the very disturbing comment,Claim
nonproliferation or the control of the spread of nuclear weapons is none of our business,Premise
recently when he was asked specifically about iraq he said there is nothing we can do about it,Premise
we will maintain our position of neutrality in the iran and iraq war,Claim
we have no plans to sell additional materiel or goods to iran that might be of a warlike nature,Premise
thats been a consistent policy one i intend to carry out,Claim
when i made my decision to stop all trade with iran as a result of the taking of our hostages i announced then and have consistently maintained since then that if the hostages are released safely we would make delivery on those items which iran owns  which they have bought and paid for  also that the frozen iranian assets would be released,Premise
i think that anyone thats seeking this position as well as other people probably have thought to themselves what about this what about that,Claim
these are just ideas of what i would think of if i were in that position and had access to the information and which i would know all the options that were open to me,Premise
i have been accused lately of having a secret plan with regard to the hostages,Claim
this comes from an answer that ive made at least 50 times during this campaign to the press when i am asked have you any ideas of what you would do if you were there,Premise
i have never answered the question,Premise
your question is difficult to answer,Claim
in the situation right now no one wants to say anything that would inadvertently delay in any way the return of those hostages if there if there is a chance that theyre coming home soon or that might cause them harm,Premise
what i do think should be done once they are safely here with their families and that tragedy is over  then i think it is time for us to have a complete investigation as to the diplomatic efforts that were made in the beginning why they have been there so long and when they came home what did we have to do in order to bring that about,Claim
i would suggest that congress should hold such an investigation,Claim
i would be fearful that i might say something that was presently under way or in negotiations and thus expose it and endanger the hostages,Premise
i think some of my ideas might require quiet diplomacy where you dont say in advance or say to anyone what it is youre thinking of doing,Claim
weve been guilty of that,Claim
someone didnt meet exactly our standards of human rights even though they were an ally of ours instead of trying patiently to persuade them to change their ways we have in a number of instances aided a revolutionary overthrow which results in complete totalitarianism instead for those people,Premise
i think that this is a kind of a hypocritical policy,Claim
at the same time were maintaining a detente with the one nation in the world where there are no human rights at all  the soviet union,Premise
there was a second phase in the iranian affair in which we had something to do with that,Claim
we had adequate warning that there was a threat to our embassy,Premise
we could have done what other embassies did  either strengthen our security there or remove our personnel before the kidnap and the takeover took place,Premise
we will continue with these commitments,Claim
we all committed ourselves as have all my predecessors in the oval office not to permit the spread of nuclear weapons to a terrorist nation or to any other nation that does not presently have those weapons or capabilities for explosives,Claim
not to make any sales of materiel or weapons to a nation which is involved in terrorist activities,Claim
not to deal with the plo until and unless the plo recognizes israels right to exist and recognizes un resolution 242 as a basis for middle east peace,Claim
to stop all air flights  commercial air flights  to any nation involved in terrorism or the hijacking of air planes or the harboring of hijackers,Claim
i have no quarrel whatsoever with the things that have been done,Claim
it is high time that the civilized countries of the world made it plain that there is no room worldwide for terrorism,Premise
there will be no negotiation with terrorists of any kind,Claim
i have never made the statement that he suggested about nuclear proliferation and nuclear proliferation or the trying to halt it would be a major part of a foreign policy of mine,Claim
i think im right,Claim
we must have a consistent foreign policy a strong america and a strong economy,Premise
as we build up our national security to restore our margin of safety we at the same time try to restrain the soviet buildup,Claim
which has been going forward at a rapid pace and for quite some time,Premise
the soviet union sat at the table knowing that we had gone forward with unilateral concessions without any reciprocation from them whatsoever,Claim
the salt ii treaty was the result of negotiations that mr carters team entered into after he had asked the soviet union for a discussion of actual reduction of nuclear strategic weapons,Premise
his emissary i think came home in 12 hours having heard a very definite nyet,Premise
taking that one no from the soviet union we then went back into negotiations on their terms,Premise
mr carter had canceled the bi bomber,Premise
delayed the mx,Premise
delayed the trident submarine,Premise
delayed the cruise missile,Premise
shut down the missile man  the three  the minuteman missile production line,Premise
i have not blocked the salt ii treaty,Claim
it has been blocked by a senate in which there is a democratic majority,Premise
the senate armed services committee voted 10 to 0 with seven abstentions against the salt ii treaty and declared that it was not in the national security interests of the united states,Premise
it is illegal,Claim
the law of the land passed by congress says that we cannot accept a treaty in which we are not equal,Premise
we are not equal in this treaty for one reason alone,Claim
our b2 bombers are considered to be strategic weapons their backfire bombers are not,Premise
to negotiate with the soviet union a balanced controlled observable and then reducing levels of atomic weaponry there is a disturbing pattern in the attitude of governor reagan,Claim
he has never supported any of those arms control agreements  the limited test ban salt i nor the antiballistic missile treaty nor the vladivostok treaty negotiated with the soviet union by president ford,Premise
now he wants to throw into the wastebasket a treaty to control nuclear weapons on a balanced and equal basis between ourselves and the soviet union negotiated over a sevenyear period by myself and my two republican predecessors,Premise
its understandable that a senator in the preliminary debates can make an irresponsible statement or maybe an illadvised statement,Claim
youve got 99 other senators to correct that mistake if it is a mistake,Premise
when a man who hopes to be president says take this treaty discard it do not vote do not debate do not explore the issues do not finally capitalize on this long negotiation  that is a very dangerous and disturbing thing,Claim
the senate has not voted yet on the strategic arms limitation treaty,Premise
there have been preliminary skirmishing in the committees of the senate but the treaty has never come to the floor of the senate for either a debate or a vote,Premise
i have been critical of some of the previous agreements,Claim
weve been outnegotiated for quite a long time,Premise
they have managed in spite of all of our attempts at arms limitation to go forward with the biggest military buildup in the history of man,Premise
i am not talking of scrapping,Claim
i am talking of taking the treaty back and going back into negotiations,Claim
i would say to the soviet union we will sit and negotiate with you as long as it takes to have not only legitimate arms limitation but to have a reduction of these nuclear weapons to the point that neither one of us represents a threat to the other,Premise
that is hardly throwing away a treaty and being opposed to arms limitation,Claim
governor reagan is making some very misleading and disturbing statements,Claim
he not only advocates the scrapping of this treaty  and i dont know that these men that he quotes are against the treaty in its final form,Premise
he also advocates the possibility he said its been a missing element of playing a trump card against the soviet union of a nuclear arms race,Premise
is insisting upon nuclear superiority by our own nation as a predication for negotiation in the future with the soviet union,Premise
this attitude is extremely dangerous and belligerent in its tone although its said with a quiet voice,Claim
the adversarial relationship between ourselves and the soviet union would undoubtedly deteriorate very rapidly,Premise
it would also be very disturbing to our allies all of whom support this nuclear arms treaty,Premise
this would mean the resumption of a very dangerous nuclear arms race,Claim
it would be very disturbing to american people,Claim
it would change the basic tone and commitment that our nation has experienced ever since the second world war with al presidents democratic and republican,Premise
if president brezhnev said we will scrap this treaty negotiated under three american presidents over a sevenyear period of time we insist upon nuclear superiority as a basis for future negotiations and we believe that the launching of a nuclear arms race is a good basis for future negotiations its obvious that i as president and all americans would reject such a proposition,Premise
with regard to negotiating it does not call for nuclear superiority on the part of the united states,Claim
it calls for a mutual reduction of these weapons as i say that neither of us can represent a threat to the other,Premise
to suggest that the salt ii treaty that your negotiators negotiated was just a continuation and based on all of the preceding efforts by two previous presidents is just not true,Claim
it was a new negotiation,Claim
president ford was within about 10 of having a solution that could be acceptable,Premise
i think our allies would be very happy to go along with a fair and verifiable salt agreement,Claim
this is a formidable force,Claim
some of these weapons have 10 megatons of explosion,Premise
if you put 50 tons of tnt in each one of railroad cars you would have a carload of tnt  a trainload of tnt stretching across this nation,Premise
thats one major war explosion in a warhead,Premise
we have thousands equivalent of megaton or million tons of tnt warheads,Premise
a bridge must be built out of this dependence,Claim
americans through conservation are importing much less oil today than we were even a year ago,Premise
us dependence on arab oil as a percentage of total imports is today much higher than it was at the time of the 1973 arab oil embargo and for some time to came the loss of substantial amounts of arab oil could plunge the us into depression,Premise
weve been very successful in both cases,Claim
weve now reduced the importing of foreign oil in the last year alone by onethird,Premise
we imported today 2 million barrels of oil less than we did the same date just a year ago,Premise
this commitment has been opening up a very bright vista for our nation in the future,Claim
with the windfall profits tax as a base we now have an opportunity to use american technology and american ability and american natural resources to expand rapidly the production of synthetic fuels yes,Premise
to expand rapidly the production of solar energy yes,Premise
to produce the traditional kinds of american energy,Premise
we will drill more oil and gas wells this year than any year in history,Premise
well produce more coal this year than any year in history,Premise
we are exporting more coal this year than any year in history,Premise
we have an opportunity now with improved transportation systems and improved loading facilities in our ports to see a very good opportunity on a world international market to replace opec oil with american coal as a basic energy source,Premise
this exciting future will not only give us more energy security but will also open up vast opportunities for americans to live a better life and to have millions of new jobs associated with this new and very dynamic industry now in prospect,Claim
because of the new energy policy that weve put into effect,Premise
americans through conservation are importing much less oil today than we were even a year ago,Premise
us reliance on arab oil as a percentage of total imports is much higher today than it was during the 1973 arab oil embargo,Premise
the substantial loss of arab oil could plunge the united states into depression,Claim
i do believe that this nation has been portrayed for too long a time to the people as being energypoor when it is energyrich,Claim
the coal that the president mentioned  yes we have it  and yet oneeighth of our total coal resources is not being utilized at all right now,Premise
the mines are closed down,Premise
there are 22000 miners out of work,Premise
we have only leased out  begun to explore  2 of our outer continental shelf for oil where it is believed by everyone familiar with that fuel and that source of energy that there are vast supplies yet to be found,Premise
most of this is due to regulations which either interfere with the mining of it or prevent the burning of it,Claim
with our modern technology yes we can burn our coal within the limits of the clean air act,Premise
i think as technology improves well be able to do even better with that,Premise
we have the sources here,Claim
coal is one of the great potentials we have,Premise
we are energy rich,Premise
nuclear power there were 36 power plants planned in this country,Premise
32 of those have given up and canceled their plans to build,Claim
because government regulations and permits and so forth take  make it take  more than twice as long to build a nuclear plant in the united states as it does to build one in japan or in western europe,Premise
our government has in the last year or so taken out of multiple use millions of acres of public lands that once were  well they were public lands subject to multiple use  exploration for minerals and so forth,Premise
it is believed that probably 70 of the potential oil in the united states is probably hidden in those lands and no one is allowed to even go and explore to find out if it is there,Premise
this is particularly true of the recent efforts to shut down part of alaska,Premise
we cannot cast aside these regulations,Claim
governor reagan says that this is not a good achievement and he blames restraints on coal production on regulations,Premise
we have this year the opportunity which well realize to produce 800 million tons of coal  an unequaled record in the history of our country,Premise
regulations that affect the life and the health and safety of miners,Premise
regulations that protect the purity of our air and the quality our water and our land,Premise
we have a chance in the next 15 years insisting upon the health and safety of workers in the mines and also preserving the same high air and water pollution standards to triple the amount of coal we produce,Claim
governor reagans approach to our energy policy which has already proven its effectiveness is to repeal or to change substantially the windfall profits tax,Claim
to return a major portion of 227 billion back to the oil companies,Premise
to do away with the department of energy,Premise
to shortcircuit our synthetic fuels program,Premise
to put a minimal emphasis on solar power,Premise
to emphasize strongly nuclear power plants as a major source of energy in the future,Premise
he wants to put all our eggs in one basket and give that basket to the major oil companies,Claim
that is a misstatement of course of my position,Claim
i just happen to believe that free enterprise can do a better job of producing the things that people need than government can,Claim
as governor of california i took charge of passing the strictest air pollution laws in the united states  the strictest air quality law that has even been adopted in the united states,Premise
we created an osha  an occupational safety and health agency  for the protection of employees before the federal government had one in place,Premise
i think some of those charges are missing the point,Claim
to this day not one of its decisions or rulings has ever been challenged,Premise
i am suggesting that there are literally thousands of unnecessary regulations that invade every facet of business and indeed very much of our personal lives that are unnecessary,Claim
that government can do without,Claim
that have added 130 billion to the cost of production in this country,Claim
that are contributing their part to inflation,Claim
the department of energy has a multibilliondollar budget in excess of 10 billion,Premise
it hasnt produced a quart of oil or a lump of coal or anything else in the line of energy,Premise
were not putting restraints on american exploration were encouraging it in every way we can,Claim
we have with our fiveyear plan for the leasing of offshore lands proposed more land to be drilled than has been opened up for drilling since this program first started in 1954,Premise
if it is a wellknown fact that i opposed air pollution laws in california the only thing i can possibly think of is that the president must be suggesting the law that the federal government tried to impose on the state of california  not a law but regulations,Claim
it would have destroyed the economy of california,Claim
that would have made it impossible to drive an automobile within the city limits of any california city or to have a place to put it if you did drive it against their regulations,Premise
we had the support of congress when we pointed out how ridiculous this attempt was by the environmental protection agency,Premise
we still have the strictest air control or air pollution laws in the country,Premise
were already five years behind in what we should be doing,Claim
as for offshore oiling only 2 now is so leased and is producing oil,Premise
there is more oil now in the wells that have been drilled than has been taken out in 121 years that theyve been drilled,Premise
it is actuarially out of balance,Claim
the social security system was based on a false premise with regard to how fast the number of workers would increase and how fast the number of retirees would increase,Premise
i believe that the system can be put on a sound actuarial basis,Claim
they must continue to get those checks,Claim
its going to take some study and some work,Premise
not just passing a tax increase to let the load  or the roof  fall in on the next administration,Premise
what is needed is a study that i have proposed by a task force of experts,Claim
to look into this entire problem as to how it can be reformed and made actuarially sound but with the premise that no one presently dependent on social security is going to have the rug pulled out from under them and not get their check,Premise
this first became evident about 16 years ago and some of us were voicing warnings then,Premise
now it is trillions of dollars out of balance,Premise
the only answer that has come so far is the biggest single tax increase in our nations history  the payroll tax increase for social security  which will only put a bandaid on this and postpone the day of reckoning by a few years at most,Premise
we cannot frighten as we have with the threats and the campaign rhetoric that has gone on in this campaign our senior citizens  leave them thinking that in some way theyre endangered and they would have no place to turn,Premise
as long as there is a democratic president in the white house we will have a strong and viable social security system free of the threat of bankruptcy,Claim
these kinds of approaches are very dangerous to the security the well being and the peace of mind of the retired people of this country and those approaching retirement age,Claim
in the wall street journal early this week that a preliminary report of his task force advocates making social security more sound by reducing the adjustment in social security for the retired people to compensate for the impact of inflation,Premise
no matter what it takes in the future to keep social security sound it must be kept that way,Claim
that is the way it will stay,Claim
although governor reagan has changed his position lately on four different occasions he has advocated making social security a voluntary system,Premise
there was a serious threat to the social security system and its integrity during the 1976 campaign,Premise
when i became president the action of the democratic congress working with me has been to put social security back on a sound financial basis,Premise
that just isnt true,Claim
it has as i said delayed the actuarial imbalance falling on us for just a few years with that increase in taxes,Premise
i dont believe we can go on increasing the tax,Claim
the problem for the young people today is that they are paying in far more than they can ever expect to get out,Premise
i suggested that if this is an insurance program certainly the person who is paying in should be able to name his own beneficiary,Claim
the voluntary thing that i suggested many years ago was that with a young man orphaned and raised by an aunt who died his aunt was ineligible for social security insurance because she was not his mother,Premise
that is the closest i have ever come to anything voluntary with social security,Claim
i too am pledged to a social security program that will reassure these senior citizens of ours that they are going to continue to get their money,Claim
there are some changes that i would like to make,Claim
i would like to make a change in the regulation that discriminates against a wife who works and finds that she then is faced with a choice between her fathers or her husbands benefits if he dies first or what she has paid in but it does not recognize that she has also been paying in herself and she is entitled to more than she presently can get,Premise
id like to change that,Claim
we also need to continue to index social security payments,Claim
so that if inflation rises the social security payments would rise a commensurate degree to let the buying power of a social security check continue intact,Premise
it is obvious that we should have a commitment to them,Claim
that social security benefits should not be taxed,Claim
that there would be no peremptory change in the standards by which social security payments are made to retired people,Claim
we have an opportunity to move toward national health insurance,Claim
with an emphasis on the prevention of disease,Premise
an emphasis on outpatient care not inpatient care,Premise
an emphasis on hospital cost containment to hold down the cost of hospital care far those who are ill,Premise
an emphasis on catastrophic health insurance so that if a family is threatened with being wiped out economically because of a very high medical bill then the insurance would help pay for it,Premise
these are the kinds of elements of a national health insurance important to the american people,Claim
when i opposed medicare there was another piece of legislation meeting the same problem before the congress,Premise
i was not opposing the principle of providing care for them,Claim
i happened to favor the other piece of legislation and thought that it would be better for the senior citizens and provide better care than the one that was finally passed,Premise
i was opposing one piece of legislation versus another,Claim
i think it is disgraceful that the disability insurance fund in social security finds checks going every month to tens of thousands of people who are locked up in our institutions for crime or for mental illness,Claim
they are receiving disability checks from social security every month while a state institution provides for all of their needs and their care,Premise
i think this debate on social security medicare national health insurance typifies as vividly any other subject tonight the basic historical differences between the democratic party and republican party,Claim
the allusions to basic changes in the minimum wage is another and the deleterious comments that governor reagan has made about unemployment compensation,Premise
when they get in office they try to govern like republicans,Claim
i noticed recently that governor reagan frequently quotes democratic presidents in his acceptance address,Premise
i have never heard a candidate for president who is a republican quote a republican president,Premise
it is good fo the american people to remember that there is a sharp basic historical difference between governor reagan and me on these crucial issues  also between the two parties that we represent,Claim
these commitments that the democratic party has historically made to the working families of this nation have been extremely important to the growth in their stature and in a better quality of life for them,Premise
the most important crucial difference in this election campaign in my judgment is the approach to the control of nuclear weaponry and the inclination to control or not to control the spread of atomic weapons to other nations who dont presently have it particularly terrorist nations,Claim
there is the historical perspective that i just described,Claim
his longstanding inclination on the use of american power not to resolve disputes diplomatically and peacefully but to show that the exercise of military power is best proven by the actual use of it,Claim
the inclination that governor reagan has exemplified in many troubled times since he has been running for president  i think since 1968  to inject american military forces in places like north korea,Premise
to put a blockade around cuba this year,Premise
in some instances to project american forces into a fishing dispute against the small nation of ecuador on the west coast of south america,Premise
governor reagan who in most cases does typify his party but in some cases there is a radical departure by him from the heritage of eisenhower and others,Claim
no president wants war,Premise
i certainly do not believe that governor reagan if he were president would want war,Claim
a president in the oval office has to make a judgment on almost a daily basis about how to exercise the enormous power of our country for peace through diplomacy or in a careless way in a belligerent attitude which has exemplified his attitudes in the past,Premise
i believe that there is a fundamental difference  and i think it has been evident in most of the answers that mr carter has given tonight  that he seeks the solution to anything as another opportunity for a federal government program,Claim
i happen to believe that the federal government has usurped powers of autonomy and authority that belong back at the state and local level,Claim
it has imposed on the individual freedoms of the people,Premise
there are more of these things that could be solved by the people themselves if they were given a chance or by the levels of government that were closer to them,Premise
when he was a candidate in 1976 president carter invented a thing he called the misery index,Premise
he added the rate of unemployment and the rate of inflation and it came at that time to 125 under president ford,Premise
he said that no man with that size misery index has a right to seek reelection to the presidency,Premise
i believe there are going to be millions of democrats that are going to vote with us this time around,Claim
they too want that promise kept,Premise
today by his own decision the misery index is in excess of 20,Premise
i think this must suggest something,Claim
the president that i quoted had made a promise a democratic promise and i quoted him because it was never kept,Premise
today you would find that that promise is at the very heart of what republicanism represents in this country today,Claim
it was a promise for less government and less taxes and more freedom for the people,Premise
i dont think that can be better illustrated than in the case of guaranteeing women equal rights under the constitution of our nation,Claim
for 40 years the republican party platforms called for guaranteeing women equal rights with a constitutional amendment,Premise
six predecessors of mine who served in the oval office called for this guarantee of womens rights,Premise
governor reagan and his new republican party have departed from this commitment,Premise
a very severe blow to the opportunity for women to finally correct discrimination under which they have suffered,Premise
when a man and a women do the same amount of work a man gets paid 100 a women only gets paid 59 cents,Premise
the equal rights amendment only says that equality of rights shall not be abridged for omen b the federal government or by he state governments,Premise
guarantee of equality of opportunity which typifies the democratic arty and which is a very important commitment of mine,Claim
as contrasted with governor reagans radical departure from the longstanding policy of his own party,Premise
i happen to be against the amendment,Claim
i think the amendment will take this problem out of the hands of elected legislators and put it in the hands f unelected judges,Premise
i am for equal rights,Claim
while you have been in office for four ears and not one single state  and most f them have a majority of democratic legislators  has added to the ratification r voted to ratify the equal rights amendment,Premise
while i was governor more than eight years ago i found 14 separate instances where women were discriminated against in the body of california law and i had passed and signed into law 14 statutes that eliminated those discriminations including the economic ones that you have just mentioned  equal pay and so forth,Premise
if i were president i would also now take a look at the hundreds of federal regulations which discriminate against women and which go right on while everyone is looking for an amendment,Premise
i would have someone ride herd on those regulations,Claim
we would start eliminating those discriminations in the federal government against women,Claim
weve been remarkably successful with the help of a democratic congress,Claim
one of the commitments that i made was to deregulate the major industries of this country,Premise
im a southerner and i share the basic beliefs of my region that an excessive government intrusion into the private affairs of american citizens and also into the private affairs of the free enterprise system,Premise
we have deregulated the air industry the rail industry the trucking industry financial institutions,Premise
were now working on the communications industry,Premise
i believe that this element of discrimination is something that the south has seen so vividly as a blight on our region of the country which has now been corrected  not only racial discrimination but discrimination against people that have to work for a living,Claim
we have been trying to pick ourselves up by our bootstraps since the long depression years and lead a full and useful life in the affairs of this country,Premise
we have made remarkable success,Claim
it is part of my consciousness and of my commitment to continue this progress,Claim
what i have just described is a proper course for the future,Claim
my heritage as a southerner my experience in the oval office convinces me that,Premise
i am for womens rights,Claim
socalled simple amendment would be used by mischievous men to destroy discriminations that properly belong by law to women respecting the physical differences between the two sexes labor laws that protect them against things that would be physically harmful to them,Claim
those would all could all be challenged by men,Premise
the same would be true with regard to combat service in the military and so forth,Claim
the united states must be a nation strong,Claim
the united states must be a nation secure,Claim
we must have a society thats just and fair,Claim
we must extend the benefits of our own commitment to peace to create a peaceful world,Claim
i think they ought to remember that one vote can make a lot of difference,Claim
if one vote per precinct had changed in 1960 john kennedy would never have been president of this nation,Premise
if a few more people had gone to the polls and voted in 1968 hubert humphrey would have been president richard nixon would not,Premise
to stay strong to stay at peace to raise high the banner of human rights to set an example for the rest of the world to let our deep beliefs and commitments be felt by others in other nations is my plan for the future,Claim
i think its been a very constructive debate and i hope its helped to acquaint the american people with the sharp differences between myself and governor reagan,Claim
ive been president now for almost four years,Premise
ive had to make thousands of decisions and each one of those decisions has been a learning process,Premise
ive seen the strength of my nation and ive seen the crises it approached in a tentative way,Premise
ive had to deal with those crises as best i could,Premise
ive studied the record between myself and governor reagan ive been impressed with the stark differences that exist between us,Premise
i think the result of this debate indicates that that fact is true,Claim
i consider myself in the mainstream of my party,Claim
i consider myself in the mainstream even of the bipartisan list of presidents who served before me,Claim
its a lonely job,Claim
i believe that since ive been in office there have been six or eight areas of combat evolved in other parts of the world,Premise
in each case i alone have had to determine the interests of my country and the degree of involvement of my country,Premise
ive done that with moderation with care with thoughtfulness sometimes consulting experts,Premise
ive learned in this last three and a half years that when an issue is extremely difficult when the call is very close the chances are the experts will be divided almost 5050,Premise
the final judgment about the future of the nation  war peace involvement reticence thoughtfulness care consideration concern  has to be made by the man in the oval office,Premise
the job is a very gratifying one,Claim
with the involvement of the american people in the process,Premise
with an open government,Premise
i think your choice is very obvious as to whom you will vote for,Claim
if you answer all of those questions yes,Premise
i could suggest another choice that you have,Claim
if you dont agree,Premise
if you dont think that this course that weve been on for the last four years is what you would like to see us follow for the next four,Premise
this country doesnt have to be in the shape that it is in,Claim
all of this can be cured and all of it can be solved,Claim
we do not have to go on sharing in scarcity with the country getting worse off with unemployment growing,Claim
if all of the unemployed today were in a single line allowing two feet for each of them that line would reach from new york city to los angeles california,Premise
i think in being governor of california the most populous state in the union  if it were a nation it would be the seventhranking economic power in the world  i too had some lonely moments and decisions to make,Claim
i know that the economic program that i have proposed for this nation in the next few years can resolve many of the problems that trouble us today,Claim
i know,Claim
we did it there,Premise
we cut the cost  the increased cost of government  in half over the eight years,Premise
we returned 57 billion in tax rebates credits and cuts to our people,Premise
we as i have said earlier fell below the national average in inflation when we did that,Premise
i know that we did give back authority and autonomy to the people,Premise
i would like to have a crusade today and i would like to lead that crusade with your help,Claim
it would be one to take government off the backs of the great people of this country and turn you loose again to do those things that i know you can do so well,Claim
you did them and made this country great,Premise
the air pollution standard laws that were passed in california were passed over the objections of governor reagan and this is a very wellknown fact,Premise
when someone suggested that the occupational safety and health act should be abolished governor reagan responded amen,Premise
in the proposal for the alaska lands legislation 100 of all the offshore lands would be open for exploration,Premise
95 of all the alaska lands where it is suspected or believed that minerals might exist,Premise
which would in effect very quickly bankrupt it,Claim
they have gone for what is politically popular rather than for what might work and amount to leadership,Claim
elected officials have played along by promising to cure inflation while backing away from tough programs that might hurt one special interest group or another and by actually adding inflationary elements to the system such as indexing,Premise
i think its very appropriate that the first question in this first debate of campaign 80 should relate to the economy of the country,Claim
the people who are watching us tonight  221 million americans  are truly concerned about the poor rate of performance of the american economy over the last four years,Premise
i first of all oppose an election year tax cut,Claim
whether it is the 10 acrosstheboard tax cut promised to the taxpayers by my opponent in this debate tonight,Premise
whether it is the 275 billion tax cut promised on the 20th of august by president carter,Premise
that that simply would be irresponsible,Claim
we are confronting a budget deficit this year  and this fiscal year will end in about 10 days and we are confronted with the possibility of a deficit of 60 billion perhaps as much as 63 billion,Premise
i think weve got to have fiscal restraint,Claim
weve seen some hopeful signs perhaps in the flash report on the third quarter that perhaps the economy is coming out of the recession,Claim
weve also seen the rise in the rate of the prime,Premise
we have seen mortgage rates back up again,Premise
a sure sign of inflation in the housing industry,Premise
i would propose and i proposed it way back in march when i was a candidate in my own state of illinois i proposed 113 billion specifically in cuts in the federal budget,Premise
we ought to pay those retirement benefits on the basis of once a year rather than twice a year,Claim
save 750 billion,Premise
one of the things that we could do was to recalculate the index that is used to determine the cost of living benefits that are paid to civil service retirees to military retirees,Claim
that perhaps would save as much as 5 billion to 7 billion according to one of the leading members of the house budget committee,Premise
fiscal restraint i think is necessary,Claim
i believe that the only unpopular measures actually that could be or would be applied would be unpopular with the government and with those perhaps some special interest groups who are tied closely to government,Claim
i believe we need incentive for the individual and for business and industry,Claim
i believe that inflation today is caused by government simply spending more than government takes in at the same time that government has imposed upon business and industry from the shopkeeper on the corner to the biggest industrial plant in america countless harassing regulations and punitive taxes that have reduced productivity at the same time they have increased the cost of production,Claim
when you are reducing productivity at the same time that you are turning out printingpress money in excessive amounts youre causing inflation,Premise
it isnt really higher prices its just you are reducing the value of the money,Premise
you are robbing the american people of their savings,Premise
my plan is for a phasedin tax cut over a threeyear period tax increase and depreciation allowances for business and industry,Claim
to give them the capital to refurbish plant and equipment research and development improved technology,Premise
all of which we see our foreign competitors having,Premise
we have the greatest percentage of outmoded industrial plant and equipment of any of the industrial nations,Premise
produce more have stable money supply and give the people of this country a greater share of their own savings,Premise
i dont see where it is inflationary to have people keep more of their earnings and spend it and it isnt inflationary for government to take that money away from them and spend it on the things it wants to spend it on,Premise
conservative projections out for the next five years that indicates that this plan would by 1983 result in a balanced budget,Claim
the plan that i have submitted with detailed backing and which has been approved by a number of our leading economists in the country is based on projections,Premise
i also suggested we ought to have an emergency excise tax on gasoline,Claim
this year we will send 90 billion out of this country to pay for imported oil even though that those imports have been reduced,Premise
since i first made that proposal 15 months ago the price of gasoline which was then 80 has gone up to about 130,Premise
weve had a huge increase of about 50 a gallon since that time,Premise
all of that increase has gone out of this country  or much of it  into the pockets of opec oil producers,Premise
we ought to take put that tax on here at home,Claim
reduce our consumption of that imported oil,Claim
recycle those proceeds then back into the pockets of the american workers by reducing their tax payments their social security tax payments by 50,Claim
that i think in addition would be an antiinflationary measure that would strengthen the economy of this country,Claim
i cannot see where a 50 a gallon tax applied to gasoline would have changed the price of gasoline,Claim
it would still have gone up as much as it has,Premise
the 50 would be added on top of that,Premise
it would be a tax paid by the consumers,Claim
fifteen months ago he was a cosigner and advocating the very tax cut that i am proposing and said that that would be a forward step in fighting inflation and that it would be beneficial to the working people of this country,Premise
i believe that conservation at course is worthy in and of itself,Claim
anything that would preserve or help us use less energy that would be fine and im for it,Claim
i do not believe that conservation alone is the answer to the present energy problem,Claim
all youre doing then is staving off by a short time the day when you would come to the end of the energy supply,Premise
the fact is that in todays oil wells there is more oil still there than we have so far taken out and used,Premise
all of these things can be done,Claim
i think it is the government and the government with its own restrictions and regulations that is creating the energy crisis,Claim
we are indeed an energyrich nation,Claim
to say that we are limited and at a dangerous point in this country with regard to energy i think is to ignore the fact,Claim
it would require what is known as secondary or tertiary efforts to bring it out of the ground,Premise
this is known oil reserves known supplies,Premise
there are hundreds of millions of acres of land that have been taken out of circulation by the government for whatever reason they have that is believed by the most knowledgeable oil geologists to contain probably more oil and natural gas than we have used so far since we drilled that first well 121 years ago,Premise
we have a coal supply that is equal to 50 of the worlds coal supply good for centuries in this country,Premise
that prices may go up,Claim
as you go further and have to go deeper you are adding to the cost of production,Premise
we have nuclear power which i believe with the safest,Premise
the most stringent of safety requirements could meet our energy needs for the next couple of decades while we go forward exploring the areas of solar power and other forms of energy that might be renewable and that would not be exhaustible,Claim
we are only drilling on 2 have leased only 2 of the possible possibility for oil of the continental shelf around the united states,Premise
the government has taken over 100 million acres of land out of circulation in alaska alone that is believed by geologists to contain much in the line of minerals and energy sources,Premise
i simply cannot allow to go unpassed the statements that have just been made by mr reagan who once again has demonstrated i think a total misunderstanding of the energy crisis that confronts not only this country but the world,Claim
he suggests that we have 27 years supply of natural gas 47 years supply of oil and all the rest and that we really all we have to do is to get the government off the back of the oil industry and thats going to be enough,Premise
we are going to have to create a new conservation ethic in the minds of the american people,Claim
i proposed 15 months ago the emergency excise tax on gasoline that i did,Premise
i did it as a security measure to be sure,Claim
i would rather see us reduce the consumption of imported oil than have to send american boys to fight in the persian gulf,Premise
i think its going to take a dramatic measure of that kind to convince the american people that we will have to reduce the use of the private automobile,Claim
we simply cannot have people sitting one behind the wheel of a car in these long traffic jams going in and out of our great cities,Premise
we are going to have to resort to van pooling to car pooling,Claim
were going to have to develop better community transportation systems,Claim
so that with buses and light rail we can replace the private automobile in those places where it clearly is not energyefficient,Premise
there are things that we can do in the retrofitting,Claim
the redesign of our homes not only of our houses but of our commercial structures as well that will make it possible for us to achieve,Premise
with respect to housing when we are consuming even though our per capita income today is about the same as that of the federal republic of germany we are consuming about by a factor of two the amount of energy that they consume in that country,Premise
i think yes we will have to change in a very appreciable way some of the lifestyles that we now enjoy,Claim
according to one study that was published a short time ago  the harvard business school study  indicated that just in the commercial sector alone of the economy we could save between 30 and 40 of the energy that we consume in this country today,Premise
i think we are proving that we can go forward with conservation and benefit from that,Claim
i think it is safe to say that we do have sources of energy that have not yet been used or found,Claim
i am not an enemy of conservation,Claim
my figures are the figures of the department of energy which has not been overly optimistic in recent years as to how much supply we have left,Premise
that is the same government that in 1920 told us we only had enough oil left for 13 years and 19 years later told us we only had enough left for another 15 years,Premise
as for saving energy and conserving the american people havent been doing badly at that,Claim
in industry today were producing more over the last several years and at 12 less use of energy than we were back in about 1973,Premise
motorists are using 8 less than they were back at that time of the oil embargo,Premise
i think my opponent in this debate tonight is overlooking one other very important fact,Claim
we cannot look at this as simply a national problem,Premise
even though its true that perhaps between now and the end of the decade our total consumption of oil may not increase by more than perhaps a million or 2 million barrels of oil a day,Premise
the rest of the western world we are told may see its consumption increase from 51 million barrels to about 66 million,Premise
that additional 15 million barrels is going to cause scarcity,Claim
it is going to cause scarcity in world markets,Claim
there are at least five reputable studies one even by the american petroleum institute itself that i think clearly indicate that somewhere along around the end of the present decade total world demand for oil is simply going to exceed total available supplies,Premise
i think that a change in lifestyles  is necessary,Claim
we had better begin to plan for that now rather than later,Claim
i think that that is clearly related to the fact that going back to the time when the allvolunteer army was created in 1973  and i worked hard for it and supported it  we simply have failed to keep pace with the cost of living,Claim
today on the average the average serviceman is at least 15  and i happen to think thats a very modest estimate  15 below what has happened to the cost of living over that period of time,Premise
as a result the families of some of our young servicemen are on food stamps today,Premise
i think thats shocking,Claim
its shameful,Claim
i outlined a very specific program of increasing pay and allowances reenlistment bonuses,Claim
i would not leave this country go undefended,Claim
to protect the vital interests of this country if that became impossible if i could not despite the very best efforts that i asked the congress to put forward to raise those pay and incentives and allowances,Premise
i am well aware of the present deficiencies in the armed forces of this country,Claim
you have a report as we did recently that six out of 10 conus divisions in this country  continental united states army divisions  simply could not pass a readiness test that two out of three divisions that were to be allocated to the socalled rapid deployment force could not meet a readiness test,Premise
in most cases that failure to meet the test was because of a lack of manning requirements an inability to fill many of the slots in those divisions,Premise
i have seen figures that indicate that perhaps as of september 1980  this very month  that there is a shortage of about 104000 in the ranks between e4 and e9,Premise
there were reports public reports not long ago about ships that could not leave american ports because of a lack of crews,Premise
i talked to one of the leading former chiefs of naval operations in my office a few weeks ago who told me about 25000 chief petty officers being short,Premise
its a shame now that there are only two of us here debating,Claim
the two that are here are in more agreement than disagreement on this particular issue,Premise
the only one who would be disagreeing with us is the president if he were present,Premise
i too believe in the voluntary military,Claim
today the shortages of noncommissioned officers that john mentioned are such that if we tried to have a draft today we wouldnt have the noncommissioned officers to train the draftees,Premise
i believe the answer lies in just recognizing human nature and how we make everything else work in this country when we want it to work,Claim
recognize that we have a voluntary military,Premise
we are asking for men and women to join the military as a career and were asking them to deal with the most sophisticated of equipment,Premise
a young man is out there on a 1 billion carrier in charge of the maintenance of a 20 million aircraft working 100 hours a week at times and hes earning less for himself and his family while hes away from his family than he could earn if he were in one of the most menial jobs working 40 hours a week here at home,Premise
that meant immediately 46 of your people that were signing up had no reason for signing up,Claim
as an aid to enlistment we had an aid  46 of the people who enlisted in the voluntary military up until 1977 said they did so for one particular reason the gi bill of rights,Premise
the fact that by serving in the military they could provide for a future college education,Premise
in 1977 we took that away from the military,Premise
i think it is a case of pay scale,Claim
recognizing that if were going to have young men and women responsible for our security dealing with this sophisticated equipment then for heavens sakes lets go out and have a pay scale that is commensurate with the sacrifice that were asking of them,Premise
i think we need something else that has been allowed to deteriorate,Claim
we need a millionman active reserve that could be called up on an instants notice and that would be also trained ready to use that type of equipment,Premise
both of these i think would respond to the proper kind of incentives that we could offer these people,Claim
i think i have better opportunity however of finding the necessary funds to pay what admittedly will be very very substantial sums of money,Claim
we signed one bill or we passed one bill just a couple of weeks ago in the house of representatives for 500 million  a half a billion dollars,Premise
that is just a downpayment in my opinion,Premise
i do not support a boondoggle like the mx missile,Claim
ive just gotten a report from the air force that indicates that the 30year lifecycle cost of that system is going to be 100 billion,Premise
the initial cost is about 54 billion and then when you add in the additional costs  not only the construction of the system the missiles and the personnel and so on  when you add in the additional costs over the lifecycle of that system over 100 billion,Premise
i would propose to save the taxpayers of this country from that kind of costly boondoggle,Claim
we need the missile,Claim
we are so out of balance strategically that we lack a deterrent to a possible first assault,Premise
i am not in favor of the plan that is so costly,Claim
i happen to support and believe in the missile itself,Claim
thats not the 54 billion cost that john is talking about,Premise
hes talking about that fantastic plan of the administration to take thousands and thousands of square miles out in the western states,Premise
first he was going to dig a racetrack and have it going around in the racetrack so it would meet the requirements of salt ii treaty,Premise
now hes decided itll have a straight up and down thing so it can he both verifiable and yet hideable from the soviet union,Premise
the military is not the only area in crisis,Claim
american cities are physically wearing out as housing streets sewers and budgets all fall apart,Premise
all of this is piled upon the emotional strain that comes from refugees and racial confrontations,Premise
i dont think id have to go against that pledge,Claim
i think one of the problems today with the cities is federal aid,Claim
the mayors that ive talked to in some of our leading cities tell me that the federal grants that come with for a specific cause or a specific objective come with such red tape such priorities established by a bureaucracy in washington that the local governments hands are tied with regard to using that money as they feel could best be used and for what they think might be the top priority,Premise
if they had that money without those government restrictions every one of them has told me they could make great savings and make far greater use of the money,Premise
what i have been advocating is why dont we start with the federal government turning back tax sources to states and local governments as well as the responsibilities for those programs,Premise
seventyfive percent of the people live in the cities,Premise
i dont know of a city in america that doesnt have the kind of problems youre talking about,Premise
where are we getting the money that the federal government is putting out to help them,Premise
new york is being taxed for money that will then go to detroit,Premise
detroit is being taxed for money that lets say will go to chicago,Premise
chicago is being taxed to help with the problems in philadelphia,Premise
wouldnt it make a lot more sense if the government let them keep their own money there in the first place,Premise
there are other things that we can do with the inner cities,Claim
i have talked of having zones in those cities that are run down where there is a high percentage of people on welfare and offer tax incentives,Premise
the government isnt getting a tax now from businesses there because they arent there or from individuals who are on welfare rather than working,Premise
why dont we offer incentives for business and industry to start up in those zones,Premise
give them a tax moratorium for a period if they build and develop there,Premise
the individuals that would then get jobs  give them a break that encourages them to leave the social welfare programs and go to work,Premise
we could have an urban homestead act,Claim
weve got thousands and thousands of homes owned by government boarded up being vandalized that have been taken in mortgage foreclosures,Premise
what if we had a homestead act and said to the people for 1 we sell you this house,Premise
all have to do is agree to refurbish it make it habitable and live in it  just as 100 or more years ago we did with the open land in this country  urban  or country homesteading,Premise
the andersonlucey platform for america program for the 80s has devoted considerable time and in very specific detail we have talked about two things that ought to be done to aid urban america,Claim
first of all for the creation of a 4 billion urban reinvestment trust fund to do exactly what you spoke about in your question  to rebuild the streets to rebuild the cities the leaking water mains,Premise
i was in north pittsburgh  i think it was a few weeks ago on my campaign  the water mains in that city had begun to leak and literally there wasnt money available to fix them,Premise
they simply are not going to provide the kind of economic climate that will enable them to retain industry enable them to retain the kind of solid industrial base that they need so that they can provide jobs,Claim
until we can begin to recreate the basic infrastructure of the great cities of america particularly in the upper midwest and in the northeast,Premise
we have also provided in our program for a 4 billion community trust fund and weve told you where the money is coming from,Premise
its going to come from the dedication by 1984 of the excise revenues that today are being collected by the federal government on alcohol and tobacco,Premise
that money i think ought to be put into rebuilding the base of our cities,Claim
jobs programs to reemploy the youth in our cities would be very high on my priority list,Claim
the youth opportunities act of 1980,Premise
a billiondollar program that i would recommend to put youth to work in energy projects in conservation projects in projects that would carry out some of the great national goals of our country,Premise
i recently saw a princeton university study that indicated that the cities of america  the large cities of this country  are in worse shape today than they were in 1960,Premise
it seems to totally belie the claim that i heard president carter make a few days ago that he was the first president that had come forth with a real urban strategy to meet the problems of urban america,Claim
just this past week the crown jewel in that program that he had devised was stolen i guess because a conference committee turned down the ambitious plan that he had to increase the amount of money that would be available to the economic development administration for loan guarantees and direct loans and credits,Premise
in my view this is not the answer to the problem,Claim
it will come from the pockets of the people,Claim
john claims that he is making plain where the money will come from,Premise
it will come from the pockets of the people who are living in those very areas,Claim
the problem is with governments  federal state and local  taking 44 out of every dollar earned that the federal government has preempted too many of the tax sources,Premise
pittsburgh does not have the money to fix the leaking water mains,Claim
the federal government has preempted,Premise
the federal government is going to turn around and say well you have this problem we will now hand you the money to do it,Premise
the federal government doesnt make money,Claim
it just takes  from the people,Premise
stand in the south bronx as i did in the spot where jimmy carter made his promise that he was going to with multibillion dollar programs refurbish that area that looks like bombedout london in world war ii,Premise
i stood there and i met the people,Premise
i heard them ask just for something that would give them hope,Premise
i believe that while all of the promises have been broken theyve never been carried out,Claim
i believe that my plan might offer an opportunity for that,Claim
if we would move into those areas and let encourage  with the tax incentive  the private sector to develop and to create the jobs for the people,Premise
it seems to me that to deny the responsibility of the federal government to do something about our crumbling cities is to deny the opportunity for one thing to 55 of the black population of our country that is locked within the inner cities of the metropolitan areas of our country,Claim
in those cities today we have 55 youth unemployment among black and hispanic youth,Claim
its because they have lost their industry,Claim
they no longer present the kind of viable economic climate that makes it possible for industry to remain there or to locate there,Premise
i think government has a responsibility to find jobs for the youth of this country,Claim
the place to start is to assist in the very important and necessary task of helping cities rebuild,Claim
i would be very happy to accept the challenge of your question tonight to tell the voters of this country exactly what i think its going to cost,Claim
all too often in past elections politicians have simply been promising people things that they cannot deliver,Premise
when these presidential debates were held just four years ago i remember the incumbent president who was willing to debate president ford telling the american people that they simply ought not to vote for somebody who promised more than they could deliver,Premise
weve seen what has happened,Premise
we havent gotten either the economies in government that were promised,Claim
we havent gotten the 4 inflation that we were supposed to get at the end of mr carters first term,Premise
instead we had i think in the second quarter a consumer price index registering around 12,Premise
i think my programs are far less inflationary than those of governor reagan,Claim
nobody really knows with the latest increase in the wholesale price index  thats about 18 on an annualized basis  what its going to be,Premise
his own running mate when he was running for the presidency said that they would cost 30 inflation inside of two years and he cited his leading economic advisor a very distinguished economist paul macavoy as the source of that information,Premise
he went so far as to call it brutal economics,Premise
im going to wait until i see that that inflation rate is going down before i even begin to phase in the business tax cuts that ive talked about,Claim
i think by improving productivity they would be far less inflationary than the consumptionoriented tax cut that governor reagan is recommending,Claim
i would like to stand here and promise the american people a tax cut as governor reagan has done,Premise
its gotten to be about 122 difference,Premise
somebody worked it out,Premise
they figured out that between the tax cut that governor reagan is promising the american people and the tax cut that jimmy carter is promising in 198i his is worth about 122 more,Premise
one is going to give you 122 more if you happen to be in that range of about a 20000ayear income,Premise
you dear voters are out there on the auction block and these two candidates are bidding for your votes,Premise
i dont have to,Claim
ive done it,Premise
we have a backup paper to my economic speech of a couple of weeks ago in chicago that gives all of the figures,Premise
and we used  yes we used  the senate budget committees projections for five years which are based on an average inflation rate of 75,Premise
which i think that under our plan can be eliminated,Claim
eliminated probably more quickly than our plan but we wanted to be so conservative with it that people would see how how well it could be done,Premise
i speak with some confidence of our plan,Claim
i took over a state  california  10 of the population of this nation  a state that if it were a nation would be the seventhranking economic power in the world,Premise
that state we controlled spending,Premise
we cut the rate of increase in spending in half,Premise
at the same time we gave back to the people of california  in tax rebates tax credits tax cuts  57 billion,Premise
i believe the budget can be balanced by 1982 or 1983,Claim
it is a combination of planned reduction of the tax increase that carter has built into the economy and thats what hes counting on for his plan,Premise
hes going to get a halfatrillion dollars more over the next five years that he can use for additional programs or hopefully someplace down the line balancing the budget,Premise
we believe that thats too much additional money to take out of the pockets of the people,Claim
i vetoed 993 measures without having a veto overturned,Premise
among those vetoes i stopped 16 billion in additional spending,Premise
the funny thing was that california which is normally above the national average in inflation and unemployment for those six years for the first time was below the national average in both inflation and unemployment,Premise
we have considered inflation in our figures,Claim
we deliberately took figures that we ourselves believed were too conservative,Premise
spending in other words more than doubled and it rose at a faster rate than spending was rising in the federal government,Claim
despite his pledge to reduce state government spending that it rose from 46 billion when he took office in 1967 to 102 billion during his eight years in office,Premise
i have seen his program costed out to the point where it would amount to more than 300 million a year just for the military,Claim
i think the figures that he has given are simply not going to stand up,Claim
on his very optimistic figures about his tax cut producing a balanced budget by 1983 and the fact that he is using he says the figures of the senate budget committee that senate budget committee report does not accommodate all of the reagan defense plans,Premise
some people look up figures and some people make up figures,Premise
john has just made up some very interesting figures,Claim
we took the senate report of course,Premise
we did factor in our own ideas with regard to increases in the projected military spending that we believe would over a period of time do what is necessary,Claim
i think being governor of california is probably the closest thing to the presidency if thats possible of any executive job in america today,Claim
it is the most populous state,Premise
we did cut the increase in spending in half,Claim
john doesnt quite realize  hes never held an executive position of that kind,Premise
we reduced in proportion of other states the per capita spending the per capita size of government,Claim
we only increased the size of government onetwelfth what it had increased in the preceding eight years,Premise
one journal the san francisco chronicle a respected newspaper said there was no question about the fact that governor reagan had prevented the state of california from going bankrupt,Premise
i think that i have found a great hunger in america for a spiritual revival,Claim
i do believe that no one in this country should be denied the right to express themselves or to even try to persuade others to follow their leader,Claim
thats what elections are all about,Premise
for a belief that law must be based on a higher law,Claim
for a return to traditions and values that we once had,Claim
our government in its most sacred documents  the constitution and the declaration of independence and all  speak of man being created of a creator,Premise
that were a nation under god,Premise
i have thought for a long time that too many of our churches have been too reluctant to speak up in behalf of what they believe is proper in government,Premise
they have been too too lax in interfering in recent years with governments invasion of the family itself putting itself between parent and child,Premise
i vetoed a number of bills of that kind myself when i was in california,Premise
to try to tell the parishioners of any church of any denomination how they should vote or for whom they should vote i think violates the principle of separation of church and state,Claim
certainly the church has the right to take a position on moral issues,Premise
i think that is a moral issue that ought to be left to the freedom of conscience of the individual,Claim
governor reagan is running on a platform that calls for a constitutional amendment banning abortion,Premise
for the state to interfere with a constitutional amendment and tell a woman that she must carry that pregnancy to term regardless of her personal belief that i think violates freedom of conscience as much as anything that i can think of,Premise
i believe in freedom of choice,Claim
i dont believe in constitutional amendments that would interfere with that,Claim
i dont believe in trying to legislate new tests for the selection of the federal judiciary,Claim
he is also running on a platform that suggests a litmus test for the selection of judges  that only judges that hold a certain quote view on the sanctity of family life ought to be appointed to the federal judiciary one of the three great independent branches of our government,Premise
for me to try in this very pluralistic society of ours to try to frame any definition whatever of what that belief should be is wrong,Claim
on the amendment that you mentioned i abandoned it 15 years ago,Premise
i have said freely all over this country that it was a mistake for me or anyone to ever try to put the judeochristian heritage of this country important as it is and important as my religious faith is to me  its a very deeply personal matter,Premise
not once but twice  in 1971  i voted on the floor of the house of representatives against a constitutional amendment that tried to bring prayer back into the public schools,Premise
i think mother ought to whisper to johnny and to susie as they button their coats in the morning and leave for the classroom be sure to say a prayer before you start your days work,Premise
i dont think that the state the board of regents a board of education or any state official should try to compose that prayer for a child to recite,Claim
i dont think thats a bad idea,Claim
i think all of us should have a respect for innocent life,Claim
the litmus test that john says is in the republican platform says no more than the judges to be appointed should have a respect for innocent life,Premise
i happen to believe it is,Claim
i do believe that maybe we could find the answer through medical evidence,Claim
if we would determine once and for all is an unborn child a human being,Premise
with regard to the freedom of the individual for choice with regard to abortion theres one individual whos not being considered at all,Claim
thats the one who is being aborted,Premise
ive noticed that everybody that is for abortion has already been born,Premise
i also think that that unborn child has a right to be wanted,Claim
i also believe sir that the most personal intimate decision that any woman is ever called upon to make is the decision as to whether or not she shall carry a pregnancy to term,Claim
for the state to interfere in that decision under whatever guise and with whatever rationale for the state to try to take over in that situation and by edict command what the individual shall do and substitute itself for that individuals conscience for her right to consult her rabbi her minister her priest her doctor  any other counselor of her choice  i think goes beyond what we want to ever see accomplished in this country,Claim
if we really believe in the first amendment,Premise
if we really believe in freedom of choice and the right of the individual,Premise
there might be some feeling of unfairness about this,Claim
he was not here to respond,Premise
i would just like to remark a concern that i have that we have criticized the failures of the carter policy here rather considerably both of us this evening,Premise
i believe it would have been much more unfair to have had john anderson denied the right to participate in this debate,Claim
i want to express my appreciation to the league of women voters for adopting a course with which i believe the great majority of americans are in agreement,Premise
i still believe that,Claim
im not running for the presidency because i believe that i can solve the problems weve discussed tonight,Claim
i believe the people of this country can and together we can begin the world over again,Premise
president carter was not right a few weeks ago when he said that the american people were confronted with only two choices with only two men and with only two parties,Claim
i am running for president as an independent,Claim
i believe our country is in trouble,Premise
i believe that all of us are going to have to begin to work together to solve our problems,Premise
i dont think you do think that,Claim
i think you ought to consider doing something about it and voting for an independent in 1980,Claim
a generation of office seekers has tried to tell the american people that they could get something for nothing,Premise
its been a time therefore of illusion and false hopes and the longer it continues the more dangerous it becomes,Premise
weve got to stop drifting,Claim
those are some of the great issues  atomic warfare the use of our natural resources and the issue of nationalism  that i intend to be talking about in the remaining six weeks of this campaign,Claim
that an independent government of john anderson and patrick lucey can give us the kind of coalition government that we need in 1980 to begin to solve our problems,Claim
the living americans today have fought harder paid a higher price for freedom and done more to advance the dignity of man than any people who ever lived on this earth,Claim
we the living americans have gone through four wars,Premise
weve gone through a great depression in our lifetime that literally was worldwide and almost brought us to our knees,Premise
we came through all of those things and we achieved even new heights and new greatness,Premise
we can meet our destiny  and that destiny to build a land here that will be for all mankind a shining city on a hill,Claim
i think youve seen tonight in this debate that governor reagan and i have agreed on exactly one thing,Claim
we are both against the reimposition of a peacetime draft,Premise
we have disagreed i believe on virtually every other issue,Premise
what i wish tonight so desperately is that we had had more time to talk about some of the other issues that are so fundamentally important,Premise
a great historian henry steele commager said that in their lust for victory neither traditional party is looking beyond november,Premise
he went on to cite three issues that their platforms totally ignore atomic warfare presidential directive 59 notwithstanding,Premise
if we dont resolve that issue all others become irrelevant,Claim
the issue of our natural resources the right of posterity to inherit the earth and what kind of earth will it be,Premise
the issue of nationalism  the recognition he says that every major problem confronting us is global and cannot be solved by nationalism here or elsewhere  that is chauvinistic that is parochial that is as anachronistic as states rights was in the days of jefferson davis,Premise
it is the economic recovery program that we presented when i took office in 1981,Premise
the stagflation that we were undergoing,Premise
our tax cut we think was very instrumental in bringing about this economic recovery,Claim
we have reduced inflation to about a third of what it was,Claim
in the last 21 months more than 6 million people have gotten jobs,Premise
there have been created new jobs for those people to where there are now 105 million civilians working,Premise
there were only 99 million before 107 if you count the military,Premise
we believe that as we continue to reduce the level of government spending  the increase rate of increase in government spending those two lines will meet,Claim
which has come down from 17 to 6 percent and at the same time as the growth in the economy increases the revenues the government gets without raising taxes,Premise
they project that the budget deficit will continue to climb,Claim
in the year 1989 they project a budget deficit of 273 billion,Premise
we have the rate of increase in government spending down to 6 percent,Claim
if the rate of increase in government spending can be held at 5 percent  were not far from there  by 1989 that would have reduced the budget deficits down to a 30 or 40 billion level,Premise
every estimate by this administration about the size of the deficit has been off by billions and billions of dollars,Claim
over 4 years theyve missed the mark by nearly 600 billion,Claim
we were told we would have a balanced budget in 1983,Claim
it was 200 billion deficit instead,Claim
virtually every economic analysis that ive heard of including the distinguished congressional budget office which is respected by i think almost everyone says that even with historically high levels of economic growth we will suffer a 263 billion deficit,Premise
it doesnt converge as the president suggests,Claim

if hed had his way there wouldnt have been any housing project there at all,Claim
any proposals that i made at that time were at the request of the chairman a democrat of one of the leading committees,Claim
who said we have to do something before the program goes broke and the checks bounce,Premise
we had to borrow 17 billion to pay the checks,Claim
3 days after the election in 1982 they came to us and said social security we know is broke,Premise

more people go to church and synagogues than any other nation on earth,Claim
we kept the politicians and the state out of the personal exercise of our faith,Premise

2300000 more are receiving them,Claim
we have set a line at 130 percent so that we can direct that aid down to the truly needy,Claim
we found people making 185 percent of the poverty level were getting government benefits,Claim
we found people that there under the previous administration families that had no limit to income were still eligible for lowinterest college loans,Claim
we didnt think that was right,Claim

the economy was so worsened that i was openly saying that what we had thought on the basis of our plan could have brought a balanced budget,Premise
the plan that we have had and that we are following is a plan that is based on growth in the economy recovery without inflation and reducing the share that the government is taking from the gross national product,Claim
which has become a drag on the economy,Claim
we can now call it an expansion,Claim
we have a recovery that has been going on for about 21 months to the point,Premise
under that this year we have seen a 21 billion reduction in the deficit from last year based mainly on the increased revenues the government is getting without raising tax rates,Premise
we think must come down further,Claim
the interest rates have come down about 9 or 10 points,Premise
i do not very frankly take seriously the congressional budget office projections,Claim
they have been wrong on virtually all of them,Premise
including the fact that our recovery wasnt going to take place to begin with,Premise
when they meet that is a balanced budget,Claim
the lines arent about to meet,Claim
according to their projections,Premise
the deficit is the result of excessive government spending,Claim
if we can have a 4percent recovery continue through that same period of time that will mean 400 billion more in government revenues,Premise
i believe that we will be better off if we protect this environment,Claim
i think that the lines can meet,Claim
there has been no spending increase in the 4 years that we have been here,Claim
in constant dollars in the domestic side of the budget,Premise

youre taking the same amount of money out of the private sector,Claim
unless and until you bring down governments share of what it is taking,Claim

theres a difference,Claim
what happened right after the election is they proposed to cut social security benefits by 25 percent,Premise
reducing the adjustment for inflation,Premise
cutting out minimum benefits for the poorest on social security,Premise
removing educational benefits for dependents whose widows were trying  with widows trying to get them through college,Premise
i have fought for social security and medicare and for things to help people who are vulnerable all my life,Claim
i will do it as president of the united states,Claim
im standing up to the issue with an answer thats fair,Claim
i do,Claim
theres a difference between being a quarterback and a cheerleader,Claim
when theres a real problem a president must confront it,Claim
what i was referring to of course in the comment that you referred to was the situation in lebanon,Premise
i did not criticize the president,Claim
these things can happen,Premise
the second time the barracks in lebanon were assaulted,Premise
we all remember,Claim

the third time there was even a warning from the terrorists themselves,Premise
for three occasions one after another our embassies were assaulted in the same way by a truck with demolitions,Claim
your message has failed to get through,Premise
we must lead,Claim
i might say that with regard to the 25percent cut in social security the only 25percent cut that i know of was accompanying that huge 1977 tax increase was a cut of 25 percent in the benefits for every american who was born after 1916,Claim
believe that the people are supposed to be dominant in our society  that they not government are to have control of their own affairs to the greatest extent possible with an orderly society,Claim
i also believe something else about that,Claim
i believe that i started this,Claim
i continue it in this office,Claim
i have instructed cabinet members and staff they are not to bring up any of the political ramifications that might surround the issue,Claim
any issue that comes before me,Premise
i want to hear only arguments as to whether it is good or bad for the people,Claim
is it morally right,Claim

why i thought that his record bespoke his possible taking us back to the same things that we knew under the previous administration,Premise
he wished the deficit could be doubled,Premise
said they werent to be abhorred,Premise
we have believed in partnership,Claim
that was an example of a partnership between not only local government and the federal government but also between the private sector that built that particular structure,Premise

we discovered that the program that the cartermondale administration had said would solve the fiscal problems of social security for the next 50 years wouldnt solve them for 5,Claim
when we took office,Premise
in 1982 they used that proposal in a demagogic fashion for the 1982 campaign,Premise
i asked for a bipartisan commission which id asked for from the beginning to sit down and work out a solution,Claim
the whole matter of what to do with social security has been resolved by bipartisan legislation,Premise
it is on a sound basis now for as far as you can see into the next century,Premise
i should say as lincoln once said that i could not  i would be the most stupid man in the world if i thought i could confront the duties of the office i hold if i could not turn to someone who was stronger and greater than all others,Claim

it does play a part in my life,Claim
i have no hesitancy in saying so,Claim
i have gone to church regularly all my life,Premise
i dont feel that i have a right to go to church,Claim
my minister knows this and supports me in this position,Claim
my being there could cause something of the kind that we have seen in other places in beirut for example,Claim
all history tells us that thats a mistake,Claim
jerry falwell announces that that means they get at least two justices of the supreme court,Premise
i think if we want to continue to have a religious nation lets keep that line and never cross it,Claim
a minister who is in civil rights or in the conservative movement because he believes his faith instructs him to do that,Premise
i admire,Claim
the fact that the faith speaks to us and that we are moral people hopefully i accept and rejoice in,Claim
its when you try to use that to undermine the integrity of private political  or private religious faith for the most personal decisions in american life,Premise
the use of the state is where i draw the line,Claim
the only attacks i have made are on people who apparently would break away at that wall from the government side using the government using the power of the courts and so forth,Claim
to hinder that part of the constitution that says the government shall not only not establish a religion it shall not inhibit the practice of religion,Premise
a child wants to say grace in a school cafeteria and a court rules that they cant do it because its school property,Premise
these are they types of things that i think have been happening in a kind of a secular way that have been eroding that separation,Claim
i am opposed to that,Claim
ill stand on my record on that,Claim
if i have the opportunity to appoint any more ill do it in the same manner that i did in selecting her,Claim
it seems to me that a moments reflection tells you why the united states senate turned that amendment down,Claim
it will undermine the practice of honest faith in our country by politicizing it,Premise
i think youre going to see a very strong verdict by the american people that they favor the approach that im talking about,Claim
when people vote,Premise
they know its got to come down,Claim
american people see this debt,Premise
if it wont come down the economys going to slow down,Claim
maybe go into a recession,Claim
its unfair to our children,Premise
they know this debt must come down as well,Claim
weve had an administration that has been totally insensitive to the law and the demand for the protection of the environment,Premise
they want it,Claim
theyve understood from the beginning that when we open doors were all stronger,Premise
ive said its going to take some work,Claim
i think the american people will draw their own conclusions,Claim
i will not support the cuts in social security and medicare and the rest that the president has proposed,Claim
the president answers that it didnt happen or if it did it was resolved later in a commission,Premise
as the record develops i think its going to become increasingly clear that what i am saying and where i want to take this country is exactly where the country wants to go,Claim
the comparison of approaches is such that i think will lead to further strength,Claim
well continue to try to get things that we didnt get in a program that has already brought the rate of spending of government down from 17 percent to 61 percent,Claim
a program of returning authority and autonomy to the local and state governments that has been unjustly seized by the federal government,Premise
you might find those words in a democratic platform of some years ago  i know,Claim
i was a democrat at that time,Premise
at least it took that burden away from them,Claim
i said that we would become respected in the world once again and that we would refurbish our national defense to the place that we could deal on the world scene and then seek disarmament reduction of arms and hopefully an elimination of nuclear weapons,Claim
we have done that,Claim
all of the things that i said we would do from inflation being down interest rates being down unemployment falling all of those things we have done,Claim
i think this is something the american people see,Claim
we find 35 states with task forces now dealing with their educational problems,Claim
today without the federal government being involved other than passing on to them the school districts the words from that commission,Premise
i think that many democrats are seeing the same thing this democrat saw,Claim
i think that weve had something to do with that,Claim
just as we have with the drug problem nationwide,Premise
yes i feel as strongly as anyone about the preservation of the environment,Claim
when we took office,Premise
we found that the national parks were so dirty and contained so many hazards lack of safety features,Claim

i was chairman of minnesotans for kennedy president reagan was chairman of a thing called democrats for nixon,Premise
ill be proud of supporting him all of my life,Claim
maybe we made a wrong turn with kennedy,Claim
im very happy that john kennedy was elected,Claim
john kennedy looked at the future with courage saw what needed to be done and understood his own government,Premise
the president just said that his government is shrinking,Premise
its not,Claim
thats where government should not be,Claim
instead of retreating  instead of being strong where we should be strong he wants to make it strong and intervene in the most private and personal questions in american life,Premise
i had already voted for dwight eisenhower to be president of the united states,Claim
before i campaigned as a democrat for a republican candidate for president,Premise
my change had come earlier than that,Claim
i hadnt gotten around to reregistering as yet,Claim
i found that was rather difficult to do,Claim
i finally did it,Claim
theres been some reference without naming it here in the remarks of mr mondale tied to injecting religion into government,Premise
with me abortion is not a problem of religion,Claim
its a problem of the constitution,Claim
i believe that until and unless someone can establish that the unborn child is not a living human being then that child is already protected by the constitution,Claim
which guarantees life liberty and the pursuit of happiness to all of us,Claim
i think that this is what we should concentrate on,Claim
i know there were weeks and weeks of testimony before a senate committee,Premise
there were medical authorities,Premise
isnt it strange that that same woman could have taken the life of her unborn child,Claim
it was abortion and not murder,Claim
if somebody else does it thats murder,Claim
in california sometime ago a man beat a woman so savagely that her unborn child was born dead with a fractured skull,Premise
the california state legislature unanimously passed a law that was signed by the thendemocratic governor  signed a law that said that any man who so abuses a pregnant woman that he causes the death of her unborn child shall be charged with murder,Premise
this has been my feeling about abortion that we have a problem now to determine all the evidence so far comes down on the side of the unborn child being a living human being,Claim
it used the term death of the unborn child,Premise
no one has approached it from that matter,Claim
i know that some churches do,Claim
it does not happen that the church that i belong to had that as part of its dogma,Premise
it is a sin if youre taking a human life,Claim
in our judeochristian tradition we recognize the right of taking a human life in selfdefense,Premise
is it really the view of the american people,Claim
i think it cannot work,Claim
wont work,Claim
will lead to all kinds of cynical evasions of the law,Claim
i think these questions are inherently personal and moral,Claim
every individual instance is different,Claim
there are some things that government can do and some things they cannot do,Claim
i dont think so,Claim
we have always let the people decide in their own personal lives,Claim
in america on basic moral questions,Premise
were the most religious people on earth,Claim
i dont know the answer to when life begins,Claim
its a personal and private moral judgment,Claim
its not that simple either,Claim
youve got another life involved,Premise
im not capable,Claim
i dont think you are any of us to make this determination that must be made with regard to human life,Claim
i believe that thats where the effort should be directed  to make that determination,Claim
that too would have to be worked out then,Claim
when you once recognize that were talking about a life,Premise
i agree with that,Claim
thats why i was a principal sponsor of a liberal adoption law,Claim
so that more of these children could come to term,Claim
so that the young mothers were educated,Claim
so we found an option an alternative,Premise
i dont agree with it,Claim
the question is whether this other option proposed by the president should be pursued,Claim
the effect of these economic policies is like a massive grain embargo,Claim
which has caused farm exports to drop 20 percent,Claim
net farm income is off 50 percent in the last 3 years,Premise
every farmer knows it,Claim
in my opinion as we deal with this deficit people from about 70000 a year on down have to be dealt with very very carefully,Claim
they are the ones who didnt get any relief the first time around,Premise
under the 1981 tax bill people making 200000 a year got 60000 in tax relief over 3 years while people making 30000 a year all taxes considered got no relief at all or their taxes actually went up,Premise
thats why my proposal protects everybody from 25000 a year or less against any tax increases,Claim
treats those 70000 and under in a way that is more beneficial than the way the president proposes with a sales tax or a flat tax,Claim
vice president bush disclosed his tax returns to the american people,Premise
that meant that he paid a lower percent in taxes than the janitor,Claim
who cleaned up his office or the chauffeur who drives him to work,Premise
in 1983 as a result of these tax preferences he paid a little over 12 percent 128 percent in taxes,Premise
they hit middle and moderateincome americans and leave wealthy americans largely untouched,Claim
my proposals will be far more beneficial,Claim
up until about 70000 as you go up the ladder,Premise
id like to see the total repeal of indexing,Claim
as soon as we get the economy on a sound ground as well,Premise
at some point we want to do that as well,Claim
i dont have a plan to tax  or increase taxes,Claim
im not going to increase taxes,Claim
i can understand why you are mr mondale,Claim
as a senator you voted 16 times to increase taxes,Premise
i believe that our problem has not been that anybody in our country is undertaxed,Claim
this is why we had a 25percent tax cut across the board which maintained the same progressivity of our tax structure in the brackets on up,Claim
this indeed was a tax that hit people in the lower brackets the hardest,Claim
the social security tax of 77,Premise
it just doesnt work out that way,Claim
i dont think that to try and say that we were taxing the rich and not the other way around,Claim
if you take it in numbers of dollars instead of percentage,Premise
that person got 10 times as much as this other person,Claim
he paid 10 times as much also,Claim
you yourself could say it could not go any lower and still perform the services for the people,Claim
if you got the government down to the lowest level,Premise
you find out that it is fair and equitable across the board,Claim
if you take it in percentages,Premise
if the recovery was so complete that you knew you were getting the ultimate amount of revenues that you could get through that growth,Premise
there was still some slight difference there between those two lines,Claim
you would have to then look to see if taxes should not be adjusted,Claim
i dont foresee those things happening,Claim
i say with great confidence im not going to go for a tax,Claim
with regard to assailing mr bush about his tax problems and the difference from the tax he once paid and then the later tax he paid,Premise
i think if you looked at the deductions there were great legal expenses in there,Claim
had to do possibly with the sale of his home,Claim
something is going to have to be done in the next several years to make it fiscally sound,Claim
with regard to medicare,Premise
its time for us to say that medicare is in pretty much the same condition that social security was,Claim
there has been an increase in poverty,Claim
it is still going up,Premise
it has begun to decline,Claim
for the first time theres been a turndown in the rate of poverty for them,Claim
single women heads of household have,Premise
it had nothing to do with the transfer of payments from government by way of many programs,Claim
in this increase in poverty it all had to do with their private earnings,Claim
we have found also in our studies,Premise
were spending a third more on all of the programs of human service,Claim
they were making an income that was above anything that warranted their fellow citizens having to support them,Premise
we have set a standard that those loans and those grants are directed to the people who otherwise could not go to college,Claim
their family incomes were so low,Premise
some that didnt even feel the pain of the recession,Premise
just as in the depths of the recession,Premise
there were some parts of the country that were worse off,Claim
weve got to get the debt down to get the interest rates down so the economy will grow and people will be employed,Claim
through the urban development action grant program,Premise
we have to work with cities and others to help generate economic growth in those communities,Claim
lets try them,Claim
not as a substitute for the others,Premise
theyre not going to get jobs,Claim
if these young americans dont have the skills that make them attractive to employees,Premise
we need the business community as well as government heavily involved in these communities to try to get economic growth,Claim
there is no question that the poor are worse off,Premise
this administration has singled out things that affect the most vulnerable in american life,Claim
theyre hurting,Claim
these heavy deficits have killed exports and are swamping the nation with cheap imports,Claim
i strongly support,Claim
they want these young people to have a chance to get jobs and the rest,Claim
i think thats part of it,Claim
there is no connection between them,Claim
the connection thats been made again between the deficit and the interest rates,Premise
there is a connection between interest rates and inflation,Claim
i would call to your attention that in 1981 while we were operating still on the cartermondale budget that we inherited  that the interest rates came down from 2112 down toward the 12 or 13 figure,Premise
i dont think there is any excuse for the interest rates being as high as they are,Claim
we have brought inflation down so low,Premise
i think it can only be that theyre anticipating or hope,Claim
i will grant you that interest rates were too high in 1980,Claim
you said that these deficits dont have anything to do with interest rates,Premise
theres no way of glossing around that,Claim
thats still the case today,Claim
when these huge deficits went in place in 1981 the spread between inflation and what a loan costs you doubled,Premise
whats called the real interest rates,Premise
the result is interest costs that have never been seen before in terms of real charges,Claim
its attributable to the deficit,Claim
the economy is starting downhill with housing failure,Claim
its causing high interest rates,Premise
its ruining us in trade,Premise
its given us the highest small business failure in 50 years,Premise
deficit is ruining the longterm hopes for this economy,Claim
every chairman of the finance and ways and means committee republican leaders in the senate and the house are telling you,Premise
i think the president has done some things to raise the sense of spirit morale good feeling in this country,Claim
hes entitled to credit for that,Claim
challenging ourselves to get on with the business of dealing with americas problems,Claim
what i think we need however is not just that but to move forward not just congratulating ourselves,Premise
i think in education when he lectured the country about the importance of discipline,Claim
i have stood up and told the american people that that 263 billion deficit must come down,Claim
dont talk about growth,Claim
even though we need growth thats not helping,Premise
i think it is outrageous,Claim
for political advantage every time they do that,Premise
they scare millions of senior citizens who are totally dependent on social security,Premise
i dont think that that should be a part of political dialog,Claim
they have to live and go to bed at night thinking is this true is someone going to take our check away from us and leave us destitute,Premise
have no place else to turn,Premise
that money would not go into the general fund to reduce a deficit,Claim
if you reduce the outgo of social security,Premise
none of these things happened,Claim
after it worked i was told that lowering taxes would increase inflation,Premise
it is working,Claim
were going to continue on that same line,Claim
weve already implemented 17 percent of them,Claim
the result is exactly what we see,Claim
the flow of imports into this country is swamping the american people,Claim
many people are predicting a recession,Claim
growth is a little over 3 percent now,Claim
last report on new purchases its the lowest since 1982,Claim
you can make a judgment,Claim
the question i think should be enlarged,Claim
is america better off than it was 4 years ago and i believe the answer to that has to also be yes,Claim
we have restored much of our economy,Claim
so far it is only a beginning,Claim
by 1980 that same person was 500 below the poverty line,Premise
in 1980  or 1979 a person with a fixed income of 8000 was 500 above the poverty line,Premise
this maybe explains why there are the numbers still in poverty,Claim
personal earnings after taxes per capita have gone up almost 3000 in these 4 years,Premise

i agree,Claim
let me just say that with reference to the vicepresidents comments about the intent and the desire of the united sites and this administration the soviet union did walk out of the talks,Claim
in 1982 i believe it was their own negotiator nitze came out with a proposal called the walkinthewoods proposal which would have limited the number of nuclear arms in europe,Claim
that proposal was turned down by the administration,Claim
a proposal presented by its own administrator,Premise
that is the comment that was made by secretary haig after he left office,Claim
what it dealt with was that it dealt just with landbased nuclear missiles which is where the soviets had the bulk of their missiles,Premise
im delighted that they met with mr gromyko,Premise

thats quite different than meeting with the president of the united states,Claim
the soviet union will meet with a lot of different people,Premise
it was the soviet union that was unwilling to discuss the walk in the woods,Claim
they were the ones that gunned it down first and the record is very very clear on that,Claim
the soviets say well have a meeting when we think there can be progress and yet they left those talks,Premise
we offered first to get rid of all those,Claim

it leads to another arms race and thats that,Claim
the challenge would be in the nature of temporary mutual verifiable moratoria to halt testing in the air in the atmosphere that would respond with a challenge from the soviet union,Premise
we hope to sit down and negotiate a treaty,Claim
that was done in 1960,Premise
what that would do is it would give us the opportunity to sit down and negotiate a treaty,Claim
that was done in 1960 by president kennedy  in 1963,Premise
what he did was he issued a challenge to the soviet union,Premise
he said we will not test in space  in the atmosphere if you will not,Premise
they did not,Claim
we do not now have to worry about that type of testing,Claim
in two months they sat down and they negotiated a treaty,Premise
i think what happens is when you try to equate whether or not i have had military experience thats the natural conclusion,Claim
i dont think the soviet union for one minute can sit down and make determination on what i will do if im ever in a position to have to do something with reference to the soviet union,Claim
im prepared to do whatever is necessary in order to secure this country and make sure that security is maintained,Claim
if the soviet union were to ever believe that they could challenge the united states with any sort of nuclear forces or otherwise if i were in a position of leadership in this country they would be assured that they would be met with swift concise and certain retaliation,Claim
i think as a leader that what one has to do is get to the point where youre not put into that position,Claim
i think that if you were to take a look at the failures of this administration that would have to be number one,Claim
i will not put myself in that position as a leader in this country,Claim
i will move immediately toward arms control negotiations,Claim
thats not whats been done over the past four years,Claim
we are not doing anything to stop the arms race,Claim
if we keep talking about military inferiority  which we do not have we are at a comparable level with the soviet union,Claim

the reaganbush administration is so different from the cartermondale sic administration that the american people are going to have the clearest choice,Claim
id like to hear her talk on those things,Claim
another option  keep this recovery going until it benefits absolutely everybody,Claim
its a question of going back to the failed ideas of the past where we came in  21 percent on those interest rates inflation despair malaise no leadership blaming the american people for failed leadership,Claim
i think the vicepresidents comment about the cartermondale administration really typifies this administration,Claim
im also tickled by their comments on human rights,Claim
its an administration that looks backwards not forwards and into the future,Claim
the soviet union in 1979 allowed 51000 people to emigrate,Claim

what you have to do is make sure that ceos dont benefit from this because this could end up in the long run people making money off of this rescue plan,Premise
it brings us back to maybe the fundamental disagreement between governor palin and me and senator mccain and barack obama,Claim
that is that the  were going to fundamentally change the focus of the economic policy,Premise
were going to focus on the middle class,Claim
when the middle class is growing the economy grows and everybody does well,Premise
think a good barometer here is go to a kids soccer game on saturday and turn to any parent there on the sideline and ask them how are you feeling about the economy,Claim
youre going to hear some fear in that parents voice fear regarding the few investments that some of us have in the stock market,Claim
is going to be resounding that our economy is hurting and the federal government has not provided the sound oversight that we need and that we deserve and we need reform to that end,Claim
i think that the alarm has been heard though and there will be that greater oversight,Claim
thanks to john mccains bipartisan efforts that he was so instrumental in bringing folks together over this past week even suspending his own campaign to make sure he was putting excessive politics aside and putting the country first,Premise
john mccain thankfully has been one representing reform,Claim
two years ago remember it was john mccain who pushed so hard with the fannie mae and freddie mac reform measures,Premise
he sounded that warning bell,Premise
people in the senate with him his colleagues didnt want to listen to him and wouldnt go towards that reform that was needed then,Premise

to putting 100000 police officers on the street,Claim
to trying to get something done about the genocide in  that was going on in bosnia,Claim

it was two mondays ago john mccain said at 9 oclock in the morning that the fundamentals of the economy were strong,Premise
two weeks before that he said george  weve made great economic progress under george bushs policiesnine oclock the economy was strong,Premise
eleven oclock that same day two mondays ago john mccain said that we have an economic crisis,Premise
that doesnt make john mccain a bad guy but it does point out hes out of touch,Claim
those folks on the sidelines knew that two months ago,Claim
he was talking to and he was talking about the american workforce,Premise
and the american workforce is the greatest in this world with the ingenuity and the work ethic that is just entrenched in our workforce,Claim
thats a positive,Claim
thats encouragement,Claim
thats what john mccain meant,Claim
what ive done as a governor and as a mayor is ive had that track record of reform,Claim
ive joined this team that is a team of mavericks with john mccain,Premise
where were known for putting partisan politics aside to just get the job done,Claim
barack obama of course hes pretty much only voted along his party lines,Claim
96 percent of his votes have been solely along party line,Premise
not having that proof for the american people to know that his commitment too is you know put the partisanship put the special interests aside and get down to getting business done for the people of america,Claim
were tired of the old politics as usual,Claim
i do respect your years in the us,Claim
i think americans are craving something new and different and that new energy and that new commitment thats going to come with reform,Claim
i think thats why we need to send the maverick from the senate and put him in the white house and im happy to join him there,Claim
it was the predator lenders who tried to talk americans into thinking that it was smart to buy a 300000 house if we could only afford a 100000 house,Claim
there was deception there,Claim
there was greed,Claim
there is corruption on wall street,Claim
we need to stop that,Claim
that commitment that we have made and were going to follow through on that getting rid of that corruption,Claim
one thing that americans do at this time also though is lets commit ourselves just every day american people joe six pack hockey moms across the nation,Claim
i think we need to band together and say never again,Claim
never will we be exploited and taken advantage of again by those who are managing our money and loaning us these dollars,Claim
we need to make sure that we demand from the federal government strict oversight of those entities in charge of our investments and our savings,Claim
we need also to not get ourselves in debt,Claim
we need to make sure that as individuals were taking personal responsibility through all of this,Claim
its not the american peoplesâ€™s fault that the economy is hurting like it is,Claim
we have an opportunity to learn a heck of a lot of good lessons through this and say never again will we be taken advantage of,Claim
two years ago barack obama warned about the sub prime mortgage crisis,Premise
john mccain said shortly after that in december he was surprised there was a sub prime mortgage problem,Premise
john mccain while barack obama was warning about what we had to do was literally giving an interview to the wall street journal saying that im always for cutting regulations,Premise
we let wall street run wild,Claim
john mccain thought the answer is that tried and true republican response deregulate deregulate,Claim
what you had is you had overwhelming deregulation,Claim
you had actually the belief that wall street could selfregulate itself,Claim
while barack obama was talking about reinstating those regulations john on 20 different occasions in the previous year and a half called for more deregulation,Premise
john recently wrote an article in a major magazine saying that he wants to do for the health care industry deregulate it and let the free market move like he did for the banking industry,Premise
so deregulation was the promise,Claim
those people who say dont go into debt they can barely pay to fill up their gas tank,Claim
the middle class needs relief tax relief,Claim
they need it now,Claim
they need help now,Claim
the focus will change with barack obama,Claim
he said i dont know joe,Premise
i never have enough money to do it,Premise
we need tax relief for americans so that jobs can be created here,Claim
thats not what we need to create jobs and really bolster and heat up our economy,Claim
barack had 94 opportunities to side on the peoples side and reduce taxes and 94 times he voted to increase taxes or not support a tax reduction 94 times,Premise
barack obama and senator biden also voted for the largest tax increases in us history,Claim
we do need the private sector to be able to keep more of what we earn and produce,Claim
government is going to have to learn to be more efficient and live with less,Claim
we do need tax relief,Claim
barack obama even supported increasing taxes as late as last year for those families making only 42000 a year,Premise
thats a lot of middle income average american families to increase taxes on them,Claim
i think that is the way to kill jobs and to continue to harm our economy,Claim
the charge is absolutely not true,Claim
barack obama did not vote to raise taxes,Premise
the vote shes referring to john mccain voted the exact same way,Premise
it was a budget procedural vote,Premise
john mccain voted the same way,Premise
it did not raise taxes,Premise
using the standard that the governor uses john mccain voted 477 times to raise taxes,Premise
he did support deregulation almost across the board,Claim
thats why we got into so much trouble,Claim
its a bogus standard,Claim
the governor did not answer the question about deregulation,Premise
did not answer the question of defending john mccain about not going along with the deregulation letting wall street run wild,Premise
as mayor every year i was in office i did reduce taxes,Claim
i eliminated personal property taxes and eliminated small business inventory taxes and as governor we suspended our state fuel tax,Premise
we did all of those things knowing that that is how our economy would be heated up,Claim
that is another thing that he is known for though,Claim
where i come from its called fairness just simple fairness,Claim
the middle class is struggling,Claim
the middle class under john mccains tax proposal 100 million families middle class families households to be precise they got not a single change they got not a single break in taxes,Premise
no one making less than 250000 under barack obamas plan will see one single penny of their tax raised whether its their capital gains tax their income tax investment tax any tax,Claim
that seems to me to be simple fairness,Claim
and 95 percent of the people in the united states of america making less than 150000 will get a tax break,Claim
the economic engine of america is the middle class,Claim
its the people listening to this broadcast,Claim
hen you do well america does well,Claim
even the wealthy do well,Claim
this is not punitive,Claim
john wants to add 300 million billion in new tax cuts per year for corporate america and the very wealthy while giving virtually nothing to the middle class,Claim
we have a different value set,Claim
the middle class is the economic engine,Claim
its fair,Claim
they deserve the tax breaks not the super wealthy who are doing pretty well,Claim
they dont need any more tax breaks,Claim
theyll pay no more than they did under ronald reagan,Claim
i do take issue with some of the principle there with that redistribution of wealth principle that seems to be espoused by you,Claim
when you talk about baracks plan to tax increase affecting only those making 250000 a year or more youre forgetting the millions of small businesses that are going to fit into that category,Claim
theyre going to be the ones paying higher taxes thus resulting in fewer jobs being created and less productivity,Claim
you said recently that higher taxes or asking for higher taxes or paying higher taxes is patriotic,Premise
in the middle class of america which is where todd and i have been all of our lives thats not patriotic,Claim
patriotic is saying government you know youre not always the solution,Claim
too often youre the problem,Claim
so government lessen the tax burden and on our families,Claim
get out of the way and let the private sector and our families grow and thrive and prosper,Claim
an increased tax formula that barack obama is proposing is the backwards way of trying to grow our economy,Claim
i am,Claim
hes got a good health care plan that is detailed,Premise
hes proposing a 5000 tax credit for families so that they can get out there and they can purchase their own health care coverage,Premise
thats a smart thing to do,Claim
thats budget neutral,Claim
but a 5000 health care credit through our income tax thats budget neutral,Claim
thats going to help,Claim
he also wants to erase those artificial lines between states,Claim
we can cross state lines,Premise
if theres a better plan offered somewhere else we would be able to purchase that,Premise
affordability and accessibility will be the keys there with that 5000 tax credit also being offered,Claim
we dont call a redistribution to give the fair to say that not giving exxon mobil another 4 billion tax cut this year as john calls for and giving it to middle class people to be able to pay to get their kids to college,Claim
we dont call that redistribution,Claim
we call that fairness number one,Claim
95 percent of the small businesses in america their owners make less than 250000 a year,Premise
they would not get one single solitary penny increase in taxes those small businesses,Claim
its with one hand you give,Claim
the other you take it,Claim
he taxes as income every one of you out there every one of you listening who has a health care plan through your employer,Premise
thats how he raises 36 trillion,Claim
taxing your health care benefit to give you a 5000 plan which his web site points out will go straight to the insurance company,Premise
and then youre going to have to replace a 12000,Claim
thats the average cost of the plan you get through your employer it costs 12000,Premise
youre going to have to pay  replace a 12000 plan,Claim
20 million of you are going to be dropped,Premise
twenty million of you will be dropped,Premise
youre going to have to place  replace a 12000 plan with a 5000 check you just give to the insurance company,Claim
i call that the ultimate bridge to nowhere,Claim
the one thing we might have to slow down is a commitment we made to double foreign assistance,Claim
well probably have to slow that down,Claim
we also are going to make sure that we do not go forward with the tax cut proposals of the administration,Claim
were not going to support the 300 billion tax cut that they have for corporate america and the very wealthy,Claim
were not going to support another 4 billion tax cut for exxonmobil,Claim
what were not going to also hold up on we cannot afford to hold up on providing for incentives for new jobs by an energy policy creating new jobs,Claim
we cannot slow up on education,Claim
thats the engine that is going to give us the economic growth and competitiveness that we need,Premise
we are not going to slow up on the whole idea of providing for affordable health care for americans,Claim
we are going to in fact eliminate those wasteful spending that exist in the budget right now,Claim
the 100 billion tax dodge that in fact allows people to take their post office box off shore avoid taxes,Claim
he doesnt tell one thing to one group and then turns around and tells something else to another group,Claim
i want to go back to the energy plan,Claim
this is an important one that barack obama he voted for in 05,Premise
in that energy plan that obama voted for thats what gave those oil companies those big tax breaks,Premise
your running mate voted for that,Premise
those huge tax breaks arent coming to the big multinational corporations anymore,Claim
it was barack obama who voted for that energy plan that gave those tax breaks to the oil companies,Premise
there is not,Claim
there hasnt been a whole lot that ive promised,Claim
i dont believe that john mccain has made any promise that he would not be able to keep,Claim
obama voted for an energy bill,Claim
to do what is right for the american people,Premise
put government back on the side of the american people,Premise
stop the greed and corruption on wall street,Premise
the rescue plan has got to include that massive oversight that americans are expecting and deserving,Claim
it had real support for alternative energy,Premise
when there were separate votes on eliminating the tax breaks for the oil companies barack obama voted to eliminate them,Premise
john did not,Premise
if john really wanted to eliminate them why is he adding to his budget an additional 4 billion in tax cuts for exxonmobils of the world that in fact already have made 600 billion since 2001,Premise
she imposed a windfall profits tax up there in alaska,Premise
i agree with the governor,Claim
thats what barack obama and i want to do,Claim
we want to be able to do for all of you americans give you back 1000 bucks like shes been able to give back money to her folks back there,Claim
but john mccain will not support a windfall profits tax,Claim
theyve made 600 billion since 2001 and john mccain wants to give them all by itself  separate no additional bill all by itself  another 4 billion tax cut,Premise
yes i would have,Claim
there have been so many changes in the conditions of our economy in just even these past weeks that there has been more and more revelation made aware now to americans about the corruption and the greed on wall street,Premise
we need to look back even two years ago and we need to be appreciative of john mccains call for reform with fannie mae with freddie mac with the mortgagelenders,Claim
who were starting to really kind of rear that head of abuse,Premise
and the colleagues in the senate werent going to go there with him,Premise
we have john mccain to thank for at least warning people,Claim
we also have john mccain to thank for bringing in a bipartisan effort people to the table,Claim
so that we can start putting politics aside even putting a campaign aside and just do whats right to fix this economic problem that we are in,Premise
it is a crisis,Claim
its a toxic mess really on main street thats affecting wall street,Claim
now we have to be ever vigilant and also making sure that credit markets dont seize up,Claim
thats where the main streeters like me thats where we would really feel the effects,Claim
mortgageholders didnt pay the price,Claim
only 10 percent of the people who are  have been affected by this whole switch from chapter 7 to chapter 13,Claim
but the point of this  barack obama saw the glass as half empty,Claim
i saw it as halffull,Claim
barack obama pointed out two years ago that there was a subprime mortgage crisis and wrote to the secretary of treasury,Premise
and he said youd better get on the stick here youd better look at it,Premise
john mccain said as early as last december quote  im paraphrasing  im surprised about this subprime mortgage crisis,Premise
we should be allowing bankruptcy courts to be able to readjust not just the interest rate youre paying on your mortgage to be able to stay in your home but be able to adjust the principal that you owe the principal that you owe,Claim
that would keep people in their homes actually help banks by keeping it from going under,Premise
i believe john mccain and the governor dont support that,Claim
there are ways to help people now,Claim
ways that were offering are not being supported by  by the bush administration nor do i believe by john mccain and governor palin,Claim
that is not so,Claim
we have to consider the need to do all that we can to allow this nation to become energy independent,Claim
its a nonsensical position that we are in,Claim
when we have domestic supplies of energy all over this great land,Premise
east coast politicians who dont allow energyproducing states like alaska to produce these to tap into them,Premise
instead were relying on foreign countries to produce for us,Premise
were circulating about 700 billion a year into foreign countries,Premise
they certainly dont have our best interests at heart,Claim
energy independence is the key to this nations future to our economic future and to our national security,Claim
instead of those dollars circulating here creating tens of thousands of jobs and allowing domestic supplies of energy to be tapped into and start flowing into these very very hungry markets,Premise
when we talk about energy plans its not just about who got a tax break and who didnt,Claim
were not giving oil companies tax breaks but its about a heck of a lot more than that,Claim

we have got to encourage other nations also to come along with us with the impacts of climate change,Claim
i was the first governor to form a climate change subcabinet to start dealing with the impacts,Premise
weve got to reduce emissions,Claim
john mccain is right there with an all of the above approach to deal with climate change impacts,Premise
weve got to become energy independent for that reason,Claim
as we rely more and more on other countries that dont care as much about the climate as we do were allowing them to produce and to emit and even pollute more than america would ever stand for,Premise
even in dealing with climate change its all the more reason that we have an all of the above approach tapping into alternative sources of energy and conserving fuel conserving our petroleum products and our hydrocarbons,Claim
so that we can clean up this planet and deal with climate change,Premise
i think it is manmade,Claim
i think its clearly manmade,Claim

i guess the only answer is drill drill drill,Premise
drill we must,Claim
but it will take 10 years for one drop of oil to come out of any of the wells that are going to begun to be drilled,Premise
in the meantime were all going to be in real trouble,Claim
i have always supported it,Claim
yes senator mccain does support this,Claim
thats a fact,Claim
the chant is drill baby drill,Claim
thats what we hear all across this country in our rallies,Claim
because people are so hungry for those domestic sources of energy to be tapped into,Premise
they know that even in my own energyproducing state we have billions of barrels of oil and hundreds of trillions of cubic feet of clean green natural gas,Premise
and were building a nearly 40 billion natural gas pipeline which is north americas largest and most you expensive infrastructure project ever to flow those sources of energy into hungry markets,Premise
barack obama and senator biden youve said no to everything in trying to find a domestic solution to the energy crisis that were in,Claim
you even called drilling  safe environmentallyfriendly drilling offshore as raping the outer continental shelf,Premise
there  with new technology with tiny footprints even on land it is safe to drill and we need to do more of that,Claim
but also in that all of the above approach that senator mccain supports the alternative fuels will be tapped into the nuclear the clean coal,Claim
i was surprised to hear you mention that,Claim
because you had said that there isnt anything  such a thing as clean coal,Premise
i think you said it in a rope line too at one of your rallies,Premise
i do,Claim
i do,Claim
my record for 25 years has supported clean coal technology,Claim
a comment made in a rope line was taken out of context,Claim
i was talking about exporting that technology to china,Claim
so when they burn their dirty coal it wont be as dirty it will be clean,Premise
the governor says john is for everything,Premise
maybe hes for everything as long as its not helped forward by the government,Claim
maybe hes for everything if the free market takes care of it,Claim
but he voted 20 times against funding alternative energy sources,Premise
absolutely,Claim
absolutely positively,Claim
in an obamabiden administration there will be absolutely no distinction from a constitutional standpoint or a legal standpoint between a samesex and a heterosexual couple,Claim
the fact of the matter is that under the constitution we should be granted  samesex couples should be able to have visitation rights in the hospitals joint ownership of property life insurance policies et cetera,Claim
thats only fair,Claim
its what the constitution calls for,Premise
so we do support it,Claim
we do support making sure that committed couples in a samesex marriage are guaranteed the same constitutional benefits as it relates to their property rights their rights of visitation their rights to insurance their rights of ownership as heterosexual couples do,Claim
not if it goes closer and closer towards redefining the traditional definition of marriage between one man and one woman,Claim
unfortunately thats sometimes where those steps lead,Claim
if theres any kind of suggestion at all from my answer that i would be anything but tolerant of adults in america choosing their partners choosing relationships that they deem best for themselves you know i am tolerant,Claim
i have a very diverse family and group of friends and even within that group you would see some who may not agree with me on this issue some very dear friends who dont agree with me on this issue,Premise
but in that tolerance also no one would ever propose not in a mccainpalin administration to do anything to prohibit say visitations in a hospital or contracts being signed negotiated between parties,Claim
i dont support defining marriage as anything but between one man and one woman and i think through nuances we can go round and round about what that actually means,Claim
im being as straight up with americans as i can in my non support for anything but a traditional definition of marriage,Claim
do you support gay marriage,Claim
no,Claim
barack obama nor i support redefining from a civil side what constitutes marriage,Claim
we do not support that,Claim
that is basically the decision to be able to be able to be left to faiths and people who practice their faiths the determination what you call it,Premise
im glad to hear the governor i take her at her word obviously that she think there should be no civil rights distinction none whatsoever between a committed gay couple and a committed heterosexual couple,Claim
if thats the case we really dont have a difference,Claim
your question to him was whether he supported gay marriage and my answer is the same as his and it is that i do not,Claim
i am very thankful that we do have a good plan and the surge and the counterinsurgency strategy in iraq that has proven to work,Claim
i am thankful that that is part of the plan implemented under a great american hero general petraeus and pushed hard by another great american senator john mccain,Claim
i know that the other ticket opposed this surge in fact even opposed funding for our troops in iraq and afghanistan,Claim
barack obama voted against funding troops there after promising that he would not do so,Premise
i respected you when you called him out on that,Claim
you said that his vote was political and you said it would cost lives,Premise
and barack obama at first said he would not do that,Premise
he turned around under political pressure,Claim
he voted against funding the troops,Premise
we do have a plan for withdrawal,Claim
we dont need early withdrawal out of iraq,Claim
we cannot afford to lose there or were going to be no better off in the war in afghanistan either,Claim
we have got to win in iraq,Claim
with the surge that has worked were now down to presurge numbers in iraq,Premise
thats where we can be,Claim
we can start putting more troops in afghanistan,Claim
we also work with our nato allies who are there strengthening us,Premise
we need to grow our military,Claim
we cannot afford to lose against al qaeda and the shia extremists who are still there still fighting us,Claim
were getting closer and closer to victory,Premise
and it would be a travesty if we quit now in iraq,Claim
the only odd man out here only one left out is john mccain number one,Claim
i didnt hear a plan,Claim
barack obama has offered a clear plan,Claim
shift responsibility to the iraqis over the next 16 months,Premise
draw down our combat troops,Premise
ironically the same plan that maliki the prime minister of iraq and george bush are now negotiating,Premise
with regard to barack obama not  quote  funding the troops john mccain voted the exact same way,Premise
john mccain voted against funding the troops because of an amendment he voted against had a timeline in it to draw down american troops,Claim
john said im not going to fund the troops if in fact theres a timeline,Premise
barack obama and i agree fully and completely on one thing youve got to have a time line to draw down the troops and shift responsibility to the iraqis,Claim
were spending 10 billion a month while the iraqis have an 80 billion surplus,Premise
this is a fundamental difference between us we will end this war,Claim
for john mccain theres no end in sight to end this war fundamental difference,Claim
we will end this war,Claim
barack says its time for them to spend their own money and have the 400000 military weâ€™ve trained for them begin to take their own responsibility and gradually over six months  16 months withdrawal,Claim
your plan is a white flag of surrender in iraq and that is not what our troops need to hear today thats for sure,Claim
and its not what our nation needs to be able to count on,Claim
you guys opposed the surge,Claim
the surge worked,Claim
barack obama still cant admit the surge works,Claim
well know when were finished in iraq when the iraqi government can govern its people and when the iraqi security forces can secure its people,Claim
and our commanders on the ground will tell us when those conditions have been met,Claim
now you said regarding senator mccains military policies there senator biden that you supported a lot of these things,Premise
in fact you said in fact that you wanted to run youd be honored to run with him on the ticket,Premise
and thats an indication i think of some of the support that you had at least until you became the vp pick here,Claim
you also said that barack obama was not ready to be commander in chief,Premise
i know again that you opposed the move that he made to try to cut off funding for the troops,Premise
i dont know how you can defend that position now but i know that you know especially with your son in the national guard,Claim
i have great respect for your family also and the honor that you show our military,Claim
anyone i think who can cut off funding for the troops after promising not to is another story,Claim
john mccain voted against an amendment containing 1 billion 600 million that i had gotten to get mraps those things that are protecting the governors son and pray god my son and a lot of other sons and daughters,Claim
he voted against it,Claim
john mccain voted to cut off funding for the troops,Claim
he said the amendment had a time line in it to end this war and he didnt like that,Premise
john mccain has been dead wrong,Claim
hes been dead wrong on the fundamental issues relating to the conduct of the war,Claim
i love him,Claim
john mccain and dick cheney said when i was saying we would not be greeted as liberators we would not  this war would take a decade not a day not a week not six months we would not be out of there quickly,Premise
john mccain was saying the sunnis and shias got along with each other without reading the history of the last 700 years,Premise
john mccain said there would be enough oil to pay for this,Premise
barack obama has been right,Claim
there are the facts,Claim
theyre both extremely dangerous,Claim
i always am focused i have been focusing on for a long time along with barack on pakistan,Claim
iran getting a nuclear weapon would be very very destabilizing,Claim
they are not close to getting a nuclear weapon thats able to be deployed,Claim
so theyre both very dangerous,Claim
they both would be game changers,Claim
john continues to tell us that the central war in the front on terror is in iraq,Claim
pakistan already has nuclear weapons,Premise
pakistan already has deployed nuclear weapons,Premise
pakistans weapons can already hit israel and the mediterranean,Premise
if an attack comes in the homeland its going to come as our security services have said it is going to come from al qaeda planning in the hills of afghanistan and pakistan,Claim
thats where they live,Premise
thats where they are,Premise
thats where it will come from,Premise
and right now that resides in pakistan,Premise
a stable government needs to be established,Claim
we need to support that democracy by helping them not only with their military but with their governance as well as their economic wellbeing,Claim
there have been 7000 madrasses built along that border,Premise
we should be helping them build schools to compete for those hearts and minds of the people in the region,Claim
so that were actually able to take on terrorism,Premise
thats where bin laden lives,Premise
we will go at him if we have actionable intelligence,Claim
both are extremely dangerous of course,Claim
as for who termed that central war on terror being in iraq it was general petraeus and al qaeda,Claim
its probably the only thing that theyre ever going to agree on,Claim
you dont have to believe me or john mccain on that,Claim
an armed nuclear armed especially iran is so extremely dangerous to consider,Claim
they cannot be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons period,Claim
israel is in jeopardy of course when were dealing with ahmadinejad as a leader of iran,Claim
iran claiming that israel is he termed it a stinking corpse a country that should be wiped off the face of the earth,Premise
a leader like ahmadinejad who is not sane or stable when he says things like that is not one whom we can allow to acquire nuclear energy nuclear weapons,Claim
an issue like that taken up by a presidential candidate goes beyond naivete and goes beyond poor judgment,Claim
a statement that he made like that is downright dangerous,Claim
because leaders like ahmadinejad who would seek to acquire nuclear weapons and wipe off the face of the earth an ally like we have in israel should not be met with without preconditions and diplomatic efforts being undertaken first,Premise
no and dr henry kissinger especially,Claim
and thats what john mccain and i would engage in also,Claim
those who would try to destroy what we stand for cannot be met with just sitting down on a presidential level as barack obama had said he would be willing to do,Claim
that is beyond bad judgment,Claim
that is dangerous,Claim
no diplomacy is very important,Claim
first and foremost that is what we would engage in,Claim
but diplomacy is hard work by serious people,Claim
its lining out clear objectives and having your friends and your allies ready to back you up there,Premise
and have sanctions lined up also before any kind of presidential summit would take place,Premise
thats just simply not true about barack obama,Claim
he did not say sit down with ahmadinejad,Claim
it surprises me that senator mccain doesnt realize that ahmadinejad does not control the security apparatus in iran,Claim
the theocracy controls the security apparatus,Claim
five secretaries of state did say we should talk with and sit down,Premise
our friends and allies have been saying gwen sit down talk talk talk,Premise
our friends and allies have been saying that five secretaries of state three of them republicans,Premise
and john mccain has said he would go along with an agreement but he wouldnt sit down,Premise
and look what president bush did,Premise
after five years he finally sent a highranking diplomat to meet with the highestranking diplomats in iran in europe to try to work out an arrangement,Premise
our allies are on that same page,Claim
and if we dont go the extra mile on diplomacy what makes you think the allies are going to sit with us,Premise
john mccain said as recently as a couple of weeks ago he wouldnt even sit down with the government of spain a nato ally that has troops in afghanistan with us now,Premise
i find that incredible,Claim
a twostate solution is the solution,Claim
that needs to be done,Claim
that will be top of an agenda item also under a mccainpalin administration,Claim
israel is our strongest and best ally in the middle east,Claim
we have got to assure them that we will never allow a second holocaust,Claim
we will support israel,Claim
a twostate solution building our embassy also in jerusalem those things that we look forward to being able to accomplish,Claim
they have a track record of being able to forge these peace agreements,Premise
they succeeded with jordan,Premise
they succeeded with egypt,Premise
im sure that were going to see more success there also,Claim
its got to be a commitment of the united states of america though,Claim
i can promise you in a mccainpalin administration that commitment is there to work with our friends in israel,Claim
no one in the united states senate has been a better friend to israel than joe biden,Claim
i would have never ever joined this ticket were i not absolutely sure barack obama shared my passion,Claim
it has been an abject failure this administrations policy,Claim
in fairness to secretary rice shes trying to turn it around now in the seventh or eighth year,Claim
barack obama said big mistake hamas will win youll legitimize them,Premise
hamas won,Premise
the policy of this administration has been an abject failure,Claim
when we kicked  along with france we kicked hezbollah out of lebanon i said and barack said move nato forces in there fill the vacuum because if you dont know  if you dont hezbollah will control it,Premise
hezbollah is a legitimate part of the government in the country immediately to the north of israel,Premise
and speaking of freedom being on the march the only thing on the march is iran,Claim
its closer to a bomb,Claim
its proxies now have a major stake in lebanon as well as in the gaza strip with hamas,Premise
we will change this policy with thoughtful real live diplomacy that understands that you must back israel in letting them negotiate support their negotiation and stand with them not insist on policies like this administration has,Claim
no i do not believe that it has been,Claim
im so encouraged to know that we both love israel and i think that is a good thing to get to agree on,Claim
no in fact when we talk about the bush administration theres a time too when americans are going to say enough is enough with your ticket on constantly looking backwards and pointing fingers and doing the blame game,Claim
but for a ticket that wants to talk about change and looking into the future theres just too much fingerpointing backwards to ever make us believe that thats where youre going,Claim
there have been huge blunders in the war,Claim
there have been huge blunders throughout this administration as there are with every administration,Claim
positive change is coming though,Claim
reform of government is coming,Claim
well learn from the past mistakes in this administration and other administrations,Claim
and were going to forge ahead with putting government back on the side of the people and making sure that our country comes first,Claim
thats what john mccain has been known for in all these years,Claim
he has been the maverick,Claim
he has ruffled feathers,Claim
but change is coming,Claim
i know senator biden you have respected him for that,Claim
i havent heard anything yet,Claim
i havent heard how his policy is going to be different on iran than george bushs,Claim
i havent heard how his policy is going to be different with israel than george bushs,Claim
i havent heard how his policy in afghanistan is going to be different than george bushs,Claim
i havent heard how his policy in pakistan is going to be different than george bushs,Claim
it may be,Claim
but so far it is the same as george bushs,Claim
we will make significant change so once again were the most respected nation in the world,Claim
thats what were going to do,Claim
those dangerous regimes again cannot be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons period,Claim
our nuclear weaponry here in the us is used as a deterrent,Claim
and thats a safe stable way to use nuclear weaponry,Claim
nuclear weaponry of course would be the be all end all of just too many people in too many parts of our planet,Premise
but for those countries  north korea also under kim jongil  we have got to make sure that were putting the economic sanctions on these countries and that we have friends and allies supporting us in this,Claim
to make sure that leaders like kim jongil and ahmadinejad are not allowed to acquire to proliferate or to use those nuclear weapons,Premise
it is that important,Claim
the surge principles not the exact strategy but the surge principles that have worked in iraq need to be implemented in afghanistan also,Claim
and that perhaps would be a difference with the bush administration,Claim
and such a reckless reckless comment and untrue comment again hurts our cause,Claim
thats not what were doing there,Claim
were fighting terrorists and were securing democracy and were building schools for children there so that there is opportunity in that country also,Claim
there will be a big difference there and we will win in  in afghanistan also,Claim
our commanding general in afghanistan said the surge principle in iraq will not work in afghanistan not joe biden our commanding general in afghanistan,Premise
he said we need more troops,Premise
we need governmentbuilding,Claim
we need to spend more money on the infrastructure in afghanistan,Claim
look we have spent more money  we spend more money in three weeks on combat in iraq than we spent on the entirety of the last seven years that we have been in afghanistan building that country,Premise
nuclear weapons require a nuclear arms control regime,Claim
john mccain voted against a comprehensive nucleartestban treaty that every republican has supported,Premise
john mccain has opposed amending the nucleartestban treaty with an amendment to allow for inspections,Premise
john mccain has not been  has not been the kind of supporter for dealing with,Claim
barack obama first thing he did when he came to the united states senate new senator reached across the aisle to my colleague dick lugar a republican and said weve got to do something about keeping nuclear weapons out of the hands of terrorists,Premise
they put together a piece of legislation that in fact was serious and real,Premise
i know that john mccain has been opposed to extending the arms control regime in the world,Claim
well first mcclellan did not say definitively the surge principles would not work in afghanistan,Claim
certainly accounting for different conditions in that different country and conditions are certainly different,Premise
we have nato allies helping us for one,Premise
the counterinsurgency principles could work in afghanistan,Claim
mcclellan didnt say anything opposite of that,Premise
the counterinsurgency strategy going into afghanistan clearing holding rebuilding the civil society and the infrastructure can work in afghanistan,Claim
and those leaders who are over there who have also been advising george bush on this have not said anything different but that,Premise
our commanding general did say that,Claim
while barack and i and chuck hagel and dick lugar have been calling for more money to help in afghanistan more troops in afghanistan john mccain was saying two years ago quote the reason we dont read about afghanistan anymore in the paper its succeededbarack obama was saying we need more troops there,Premise
again we spend in three weeks on combat missions in iraq more than we spent in the entire time we have been in afghanistan,Premise
that will change in a barack obama administration,Claim
i think the american public has the stomach for success,Claim
and initially john mccain opposed it along with a lot of other people,Premise
but the end result was it worked,Claim
they saved tens of thousands of lives,Premise
i admit i was the first one to recommend it,Premise
john mccain said no it was going to be ok,Premise
i dont have the stomach for genocide when it comes to darfur,Claim
we took serbs croats and bosniaks being told by everyone i was told by everyone that this would mean that they had been fighting and killing each other for a thousand years it would never work,Premise
theres a relatively stable government there now as there is in kosovo,Premise
with regard to iraq i indicated that it would be a mistake to  i gave the president the power,Claim
i voted for the power because he said he needed it not to go to war but to keep the united states the un in line to keep sanctions on iraq and not let them be lifted,Premise
i along with dick lugar before we went to war said if we were to go to war without our allies without the kind of support we need wed be there for a decade and itd cost us tens of billions of dollars,Premise
we can now impose a nofly zone,Claim
its within our capacity,Claim
we can lead nato if were willing to take a hard stand,Claim
ive seen the suffering thousands and tens of thousands have died and are dying,Premise
we can,Claim
ive been in those camps in chad,Premise
we should rally the world to act and we should demonstrate it by our own movement to provide the helicopters to get the 21000 forces of the african union in there now to stop this genocide,Claim
oh yeah its so obvious im a washington outsider,Claim
and someone just not used to the way you guys operate,Claim
because here you voted for the war and now you oppose the war,Premise
youre one who says as so many politicians do i was for it before i was against it or vice versa,Premise
americans are craving that straight talk and just want to know hey if you voted for it tell us why you voted for it and it was a war resolution,Claim
and you had supported john mccains military strategies pretty adamantly until this race and you had opposed very adamantly barack obamas military strategy including cutting off funding for the troops that attempt all through the primary,Premise
and i watched those debates so i remember what those were all about,Premise
but as for as darfur we can agree on that also the supported of the nofly zone making sure that all options are on the table there also,Claim
america is in a position to help,Claim
what ive done in my position to help as the governor of a state thats pretty rich in natural resources we have a 40 billion investment fund a savings fund called the alaska permanent fund,Premise
when i and others in the legislature found out we had some millions of dollars in sudan we called for divestment through legislation of those dollars to make sure we werent doing anything that would be seen as condoning the activities there in darfur,Premise
that legislation hasnt passed yet but it needs to,Claim
because all of us as individuals and as humanitarians and as elected officials should do all we can to end those atrocities in that region of the world,Premise
absolutely,Claim
there is a line that should be drawn,Claim
the line that should be drawn is whether we a first of all have the capacity to do anything about it number one,Claim
and number two there are certain new lines that have to be drawn internationally,Claim
i never supported john mccains strategy on the war,Claim
when a country engages in genocide when a country engaging in harboring terrorists and will do nothing about it at that point that country in my view and baracks view forfeits their right to say you have no right to intervene at all,Claim
john mccain said exactly what dick cheney said go back and look at barack obamas statements and mine,Premise
go look at joebidencom contemporaneously held hearings in the summer before we went to war saying if we went to war we would not be greeted as liberator,Premise
we would have a fight between sunnis and shias,Premise
we would be tied down for a decade and cost us hundreds of billions of dollars,Premise
john mccain was saying the exact opposite,Premise
john mccain was lock step with dick cheney at that point how this was going to be easy,Premise
so john mccains strategy in this war not just whether or not to go the actual conduct of the war has been absolutely wrong from the outset,Claim
i beg to disagree with you again here on whether you supported barack obama or john mccains strategies,Claim
i think tomorrow morning the pundits are going to start do the who said what at what time and well have proof of some of this,Claim
but again john mccain who knows how to win a war,Claim
whos been there and hes faced challenges and he knows what evil is and knows what it takes to overcome the challenges here with our military,Premise
he knows to learn from the mistakes and blunders we have seen in the war in iraq especially,Premise
he will know how to implement the strategies working with our commanders and listening to what they have to say taking the politics out of these war issues,Premise
hell know how to win a war,Premise
it would be a national tragedy of historic proportions if it were to happen,Claim
i would carry out barack obamas policies his policies of reinstating the middle class,Claim
making sure they get a fair break,Claim
making sure they have access to affordable health insurance,Claim
making sure they get serious tax breaks,Claim
making sure we can help their children get to college,Claim
making sure there is an energy policy that leads us in the direction of not only toward independence and clean environment but an energy policy that creates 5 million new jobs,Claim
a foreign policy that ends this war in iraq,Claim
a foreign policy that goes after the one mission the american public gave the president after 911 to get and capture or kill bin laden and to eliminate al qaeda,Claim
a policy that would in fact engage our allies in making sure that we knew we were acting on the same page and not dictating,Claim
and a policy that would reject the bush doctrine of preemption and regime change,Claim
replace it with a doctrine of prevention and cooperation,Claim
this is the biggest ticket item that we have in this election,Claim
this is the most important election you will ever ever have voted in any of you since 1932,Claim
and theres such stark differences,Claim
i would follow through on baracks policies,Claim
because in essence i agree with every major initiative he is suggesting,Premise
a team of mavericks of course were not going to agree on 100 percent of everything,Claim
as we discuss anwr there at least we can agree to disagree on that one,Claim
i will keep pushing him on anwr,Claim
what i would do also if that were to ever happen though is to continue the good work he is so committed to of putting government back on the side of the people,Claim
get rid of the greed and corruption on wall street and in washington,Claim
i think we need a little bit of reality from wasilla main street there brought to washington dc,Claim
so that people there can understand how the average working class family is viewing bureaucracy in the federal government and congress and the inaction of congress,Premise
just everyday workingclass americans saying you know government just get out of my way,Premise
if youre going to do any harm and mandate more things on me and take more of my money and income tax and business taxes,Premise
all youve got to do is go down union street with me in wilmington or go to katies restaurant or walk into home depot with me where i spend a lot of time and you ask anybody in there whether or not the economic and foreign policy of this administration has made them better off in the last eight years,Premise
and then ask them whether theres a single major initiative that john mccain differs with the president on,Premise
on taxes on iraq on afghanistan on the whole question of how to help education on the dealing with health care,Premise
look the people in my neighborhood they get it,Premise
they get it,Premise
they know theyve been getting the short end of the stick,Premise
these people know the middle class has gotten the short end,Premise
so walk with me in my neighborhood go back to my old neighborhood in claymont an old steel town or go up to scranton with me,Premise
the wealthy have done very well,Premise
corporate america has been rewarded,Premise
its time we change it,Claim
barack obama will change it,Claim
say it aint so joe there you go again pointing backwards again,Claim
you prefaced your whole comment with the bush administration,Premise
i know education you are passionate about,Claim
with your wife being a teacher for 30 years,Premise
now doggone it lets look ahead and tell americans what we have to plan to do for them in the future,Claim
i say too with education america needs to be putting a lot more focus on that and our schools have got to be really ramped up in terms of the funding that they are deserving,Claim
teachers needed to be paid more,Claim
i come from a house full of school teachers,Premise
my grandma was,Premise
my dad who is in the audience today hes a schoolteacher had been for many years,Premise
education in america has been in some sense in some of our states just accepted to be a little bit lax,Premise
we have got to increase the standards,Claim
no child left behind was implemented,Premise
its not doing the job though,Premise
we need flexibility in no child left behind,Claim
we need to put more of an emphasis on the profession of teaching,Claim
we need to make sure that education in either one of our agendas i think absolute top of the line,Claim
its near and dear to my heart,Claim
my kids as public school participants right now,Premise
im very very concerned about where were going with education,Premise
we have got to ramp it up and put more attention in that arena,Claim
of course we know what a vice president does,Claim
it was a lame attempt at a joke and yours was a lame attempt at a joke too i guess,Claim
because nobody got it,Premise
of course we know what a vice president does,Claim
and thats not only to preside over the senate and will take that position very seriously also,Premise
i dont know any government program that john is supporting not early education more money for it,Claim
the reason no child left behind was left behind was the money was left behind we didnt fund it,Claim
but we can get back to that i assume,Claim
i have a history of getting things done in the united states senate,Claim
john mccain would acknowledge that,Premise
my record shows that on controversial issues,Premise
i would be the point person for the legislative initiatives in the united states congress for our administration,Claim
i would also when asked if i wanted a portfolio my response was no,Claim
but barack obama indicated to me he wanted me with him to help him govern,Premise
so every major decision hell be making ill be sitting in the room to give him my best advice,Claim
hes president not me ill give my best advice,Claim
and one of the things he said early on when he was choosing he said he picked someone who had an independent judgment and wouldnt be afraid to tell him if he disagreed,Premise
that is sort of my reputation as you know,Claim
so i look forward to working with barack and playing a very constructive role in his presidency bringing about the kind of change this country needs,Claim
well our founding fathers were very wise there in allowing through the constitution much flexibility there in the office of the vice president,Claim
and we will do what is best for the american people in tapping into that position and ushering in an agenda that is supportive and cooperative with the presidents agenda in that position,Claim
so i do agree with him that we have a lot of flexibility in there,Claim
well do what we have to do to administer very appropriately the plans that are needed for this nation,Claim
it is my executive experience that is partly to be attributed to my pick as vp with mccain not only as a governor but earlier on as a mayor as an oil and gas regulator as a business owner,Premise
it is those years of experience on an executive level that will be put to good use in the white house also,Premise
vice president cheney has been the most dangerous vice president weve had probably in american history,Claim
the idea he doesnt realize that article i of the constitution defines the role of the vice president of the united states thats the executive branch,Premise
he works in the executive branch,Premise
he should understand that,Claim
everyone should understand that,Claim
and the primary role of the vice president of the united states of america is to support the president of the united states of america,Premise
give that president his or her best judgment when sought,Premise
and as vice president to preside over the senate only in a time when in fact theres a tie vote,Premise
the constitution is explicit,Claim
the only authority the vice president has from the legislative standpoint is the vote only when there is a tie vote,Premise
he has no authority relative to the congress,Premise
the idea hes part of the legislative branch is a bizarre notion invented by cheney to aggrandize the power of a unitary executive,Claim
look where it has gotten us,Claim
it has been very dangerous,Premise
my experience as an executive will be put to good use as a mayor and business owner and oil and gas regulator and then as governor of a huge state,Claim
a huge energyproducing state that is accounting for much progress towards getting our nation energy independence and thats extremely important,Premise
but it wasnt just that experience tapped into it was my connection to the heartland of america,Premise
being a mom being one who is very concerned about a son in the war,Premise
about a special needs child,Premise
about kids heading off to college,Premise
how are we going to pay those tuition bills,Premise
we know what other americans are going through as they sit around the kitchen table and try to figure out how are they going to pay outofpocket for health care,Premise
weve been there also so that connection was important,Premise
but even more important is that worldview that i share with john mccain,Claim
we are not perfect as a nation,Claim
but together we represent a perfect ideal,Claim
that is democracy and tolerance and freedom and equal rights,Claim
those things that we stand for that can be put to good use as a force for good in this world,Premise
youre very kind suggesting my only achilles heel is my lack of discipline,Claim
ohn mccain and i share that and you combine all that with being a team with the only track record of making a really a difference in where weve been and reforming,Premise
thats a good team its a good ticket,Claim
others talk about my excessive passion,Claim
im not going to change,Claim
i have 35 years in public office,Premise
people can judge who i am,Premise
i havent changed in that time,Premise
a record of change  i will place my record and baracks record against john mccains or anyone else in terms of fundamental accomplishments,Claim
wrote the crime bill,Premise
put 100000 cops on the street,Premise
wrote the violence against women act which john mccain voted against both of them,Premise
was the catalyst to change the circumstance in bosnia led by president clinton obviously,Premise
i understand what its like to be a single parent,Claim
when my wife and daughter died and my two sons were gravely injured i understand what its like as a parent to wonder what its like if your kids going to make it,Premise
i understand what its like to sit around the kitchen table with a father who says ive got to leave champ because theres no jobs here,Claim
im much better off than almost all americans now,Claim
i get a good salary with the united states senate,Premise
i live in a beautiful house thats my total investment that i have,Premise
so i  i am much better off now,Claim
but the notion that somehow because im a man i dont know what its like to raise two kids alone i dont know what its like to have a child youre not sure is going to  is going to make it  i understand,Claim
i understand as well as with all due respect the governor or anybody else what its like for those people sitting around that kitchen table,Claim
theyre looking for help,Claim
theyre looking for help,Claim
theyre not looking for more of the same,Claim
people arent looking for more of the same,Claim
they are looking for change,Claim
and john mccain has been the consummate maverick in the senate over all these years,Premise
hes taken shots left and right from the other party and from within his own party because hes had to take on his own party when the time was right when he recognized it was time to put partisanship aside and just do what was right for the american people,Premise
thats what ive done as governor,Premise
take on my own party when i had to,Premise
work with both sides of the aisle in my cabinet appointing those who would serve regardless of party democrats independents republicans whatever it took to get the job done,Premise
john mccains maverick position that hes in thats really prompt up to and indicated by the supporters that he has,Premise
look at lieberman and giuliani and romney and lingle and all of us who come from such a diverse background of  of policy and of partisanship all coming together at this time recognizing he is the man that we need to leave  lead in these next four years because these are tumultuous times,Premise
we have got to win the wars,Claim
we have got to get our economy back on track,Claim
we have got to not allow the greed and corruption on wall street anymore,Claim
and we have not got to allow the partisanship that has really been entrenched in washington dc no matter whos been in charge,Claim
when the republicans were in charge i didnt see a lot of progress there either,Premise
when the democrats either though this last go around for the last two years,Premise
change is coming,Claim
and john mccain is the leader of that reform,Claim
hes been a maverick on some issues but he has been no maverick on the things that matter to peoples lives,Claim
he voted four out of five times for george bushs budget which put us a half a trillion dollars in debt this year and over 3 trillion in debt since hes got there,Premise
he has not been a maverick in providing health care for people,Premise
he has voted against  he voted including another 36 million children in coverage of the existing health care plan when he voted in the united states senate,Premise
hes not been a maverick when it comes to education,Premise
he has not supported tax cuts and significant changes for people being able to send their kids to college,Premise
hes not been a maverick on the war,Premise
hes not been a maverick on virtually anything that genuinely affects the things that people really talk about around their kitchen table,Claim
he voted against even providing for what they call liheap for assistance to people with oil prices going through the roof in the winter,Premise
so maverick he is not on the important critical issues that affect people at that kitchen table,Claim
yes i can,Claim
when i got to the united states senate and went on the judiciary committee as a young lawyer i was of the view and had been trained in the view that the only thing that mattered was whether or not a nominee appointed suggested by the president had a judicial temperament had not committed a crime of moral turpitude and was  had been a good student,Premise
it didnt take me long  it was hard to change but it didnt take me long but it took about five years for me to realize that the ideology of that judge makes a big difference,Premise
thats why i led the fight against judge bork,Claim
had he been on the court i suspect there would be a lot of changes that i dont like and the american people wouldnt like including everything from roe v,Claim
that was one of the intellectual changes that took place in my career as i got a close look at it,Claim
the american people have a right to understand it and to know it,Claim
but i did change on that and  and im glad i did,Claim
there were times when i wanted to zerobase budget and to cut taxes even more and i didnt have enough support in order to accomplish that,Claim
but on the major principle things no there hasnt been something that ive had to compromise on because weve always seemed to find a way to work together,Claim
up there in alaska what we have done is with bipartisan efforts is work together and again not caring who gets the credit for what as we accomplish things up there,Premise
and thats been just a part of the operation that i wanted to participate in,Claim
and thats what were going to do in washington dc also bring in both sides together,Claim
john mccain is known for doing that also in order to get the work done for the american people,Claim
i believe john mccain were he here but he would acknowledge what im about to say,Claim
i have been able to work across the aisle on some of the most controversial issues and change my partys mind as well as republicans because i learned a lesson from mike mansfield,Claim
he said joe understand one thing everyones sent here for a reason because theres something in them that their folks like dont question their motive,Premise
i have never since that moment in my first year questioned the motive of another member of the congress or senate with whom ive disagreed,Claim
ive questioned their judgment,Claim
i think thats why i have the respect i have and have been able to work as well as ive been able to have worked in the united states senate,Claim
thats the fundamental change barack obama and i will be bring to this party not questioning other peoples motives,Claim
you do what i did as governor and you appoint people regardless of party affiliation democrats independents republicans,Claim
you  you walk the walk you dont just talk the talk,Claim
even in my own family its a very diverse family,Claim
and we have folks of all political persuasion in there,Claim
ive grown up just knowing that you know at the end of the day as long as were all working together for the greater good its going to be ok,Premise
but the policies and the proposals have got to speak for themselves also,Claim
and again voters on november 4th are going to have that choice to either support a ticket that supports policies that create jobs,Claim
you do that by lowering taxes on american workers and on our businesses,Claim
and you build up infrastructure,Claim
you rein in government spending,Claim
you make our  our nation energy independent,Claim
or you support a ticket that supports policies that will kill jobs by increasing taxes,Claim
and thats what the track record shows is a desire to increase taxes increase spending a trilliondollar spending proposal thats on the table,Premise
thats going to hurt our country and saying no to energy independence,Premise
clear choices on november 4th,Claim
this is such an honor for me,Claim
i appreciate too senator biden getting to meet you finally also and getting to debate with you,Claim
and i would like more opportunity for this,Claim
i like being able to answer these tough questions without the filter even of the mainstream media kind of telling viewers what theyve just heard,Premise
id rather be able to just speak to the american people like we just did,Premise
and its so important that the american people know of the choices that they have on november 4th,Premise
i want to assure you that john mccain and i were going to fight for america,Claim
were going to fight for the middleclass average everyday american family like mine,Claim
ive been there,Premise
i know what the hurts are,Premise
i know what the challenges are,Premise
and thank god i know what the joys are too of living in america,Premise
we are so blessed,Claim
and ive always been proud to be an american,Claim
and so has john mccain,Claim
we have to fight for our freedoms also economic and our national security freedoms,Claim
it was ronald reagan who said that freedom is always just one generation away from extinction,Premise
we dont pass it to our children in the bloodstream,Premise
we have to fight for it and protect it and then hand it to them so that they shall do the same or were going to find ourselves spending our sunset years telling our children and our childrens children about a time in america back in the day when men and women were free,Premise
we will fight for it,Claim
there is only one man in this race who has really ever fought for you and thats senator john mccain,Premise
it really was a pleasure getting to meet you,Claim
this is the most important election youve ever voted in your entire life,Claim
no one can deny that the last eight years weve been dug into a very deep hole here at home with regard to our economy and abroad in terms of our credibility,Premise
and theres a need for fundamental change in our economic philosophy as well as our foreign policy,Premise
and barack obama and i dont measure progress toward that change based on whether or not we cut more regulations and how well ceos are doing or giving another 4 billion in tax breaks to the exxon mobils of the world,Premise
we measure progress in america based on whether or not someone can pay their mortgage,Premise
whether or not they can send their kid to college,Premise
whether or not theyre able to when they send their child like we have abroad  or im about to abroad  and john has as well i might add  to fight that they are the best equipped and they have everything they need,Premise
and when they come home theyre guaranteed that they have the best health care and the best education possible,Premise
and in that neighborhood it was filled with women and men mothers and fathers who taught their children if they believed in themselves if they were honest if they worked hard if they loved their country they could accomplish anything,Claim
we believed it and we did,Premise
you know in the neighborhood i grew up in it was all about dignity and respect,Claim

a lot of you i think are worried about your jobs your pensions your retirement accounts your ability to send your child or your grandchild to college,Claim
i believe this is a final verdict on the failed economic policies of the last eight years,Claim
strongly promoted by president bush and supported by senator mccain,Claim
that essentially said that we should strip away regulations consumer protections let the market run wild and prosperity would rain down on all of us,Claim
it hasnt worked out that way,Premise
weve got to take some decisive action,Premise
we are cracking down on ceos and making sure that theyre not getting bonuses or golden parachutes as a consequence of this package,Claim
that means strong oversight making sure that investors taxpayers are getting their money back and treated as investors,Claim
the middleclass need a rescue package,Claim
tax cuts for the middleclass,Claim
it means help for homeowners so that they can stay in their homes,Claim
it means that we are helping state and local governments set up road projects and bridge projects that keep people in their jobs,Claim
longterm weve got to fix our health care system,Claim
weve got to fix our energy system that is putting such an enormous burden on families,Claim
you need somebody working for you,Claim
youve got to have somebody in washington who is thinking about the middle class and not just those who can afford to hire lobbyists,Premise
step one was a rescue package that was passed last week,Premise
weve got to make sure that works properly,Premise
we just found out that aig a company that got a bailout just a week after they got help went on a 400000 junket,Premise
the treasury should demand that money back and those executives should be fired,Claim
i think that this problem has become so severe as you know that were going to have to do something about home values,Claim
you go to the heart of americas worries tonight,Premise
americans are angry,Premise
theyre upset,Premise

weve got to have a package of reforms,Claim
it has got to lead to reform prosperity and peace in the world,Claim
you know that home values of retirees continues to decline,Premise
people are no longer able to afford their mortgage payments,Premise
i would order the secretary of the treasury to immediately buy up the bad home loan mortgages in america,Claim
renegotiate at the new value of those homes,Claim
be able to make those payments and stay in their homes,Claim
the diminished value of those homes and let people be able to make those,Claim
is it expensive,Premise
yes,Claim
i know how to get america working again restore our economy and take care of working americans,Claim
i know how the do that,Claim
its my proposal,Claim
its not senator obamas proposal,Premise
its not president bushs proposal,Premise
until we stabilize home values in america were never going to start turning around and creating jobs and fixing our economy,Claim
weve got to give some trust and confidence back to america,Claim
theres a lot of qualified americans,Premise
i think the first criteria tom would have to be somebody who immediately americans identify with immediately say we can trust that individual,Claim
meg whitman was ceo of a company that started with 12 people,Premise
is now 13 million people in america make their living off ebay,Premise
its going to have to be somebody who inspires trust and confidence,Claim
we dont have trust and confidence in our institutions,Claim
the corruption on wall street,Premise
the greed and excess and the cronyism in washington dc,Premise
i like meg whitman,Claim
she knows what its like to be out there in the marketplace,Premise
she knows how to create jobs,Premise
a supporter of senator obamas is warren buffett,Premise
he has already weighed in and helped stabilize some of the difficulties in the markets and with companies and corporations institutions today,Premise
the key is making sure that the next treasury secretary understands that its not enough just to help those at the top,Claim
prosperity is not just going to trickle down,Premise
warren would be a pretty good choice,Premise
there are other folks out there,Premise
weve got to help the middle class,Claim
senator mccain and i have some fundamental disagreements on the economy,Premise
starting with senator mccains statement earlier that he thought the fundamentals of the economy were sound,Premise
part of the problem here is that for many of you wages and incomes have flatlined,Claim
it is getting harder and harder to save harder and harder to retire,Claim
on tax policy what i want to do is provide a middle class tax cut to 95 percent of working americans those who are working two jobs people who are not spending enough time with their kids,Claim
they are struggling to make ends meet,Premise
senator mccain is right that weve got to stabilize housing prices,Claim
underlying that is loss of jobs and loss of income,Claim
hats something that the next treasury secretary is going to have to work on,Premise
the greed and excess in washington and wall street main street was paying a very heavy price,Premise
i believe that its rescue,Claim
through this economic crisis most of the people that i know have had a difficult time,Premise
through this bailout package i was wondering what it is thats going to actually help those people out,Premise
i left my campaign and suspended it to go back to washington,Premise
to make sure that there were additional protections for the taxpayer in the form of good oversight,Premise
in the form of taxpayers being the first to be paid back when our economy recovers  and it will recover  and a number of other measures,Premise
one of the real catalysts really the match that lit this fire was fannie mae and freddie mac,Claim
theyre the ones that with the encouragement of senator obama and his cronies and his friends in washington,Claim
that went out and made all these risky loans gave them to people that could never afford to pay back,Claim
there were some of us that stood up two years ago and said weve got to enact legislation to fix this,Claim
weve got to stop this greed and excess,Claim
the democrats in the senate and some  and some members of congress defended what fannie and freddie were doing,Premise
they resisted any change,Premise
they were getting all kinds of money in campaign contributions,Premise
senator obama was the second highest recipient of fannie mae and freddie mac money in history,Premise
this rescue package means that we will stabilize markets we will shore up these institutions,Claim
its not enough,Claim
were going to have to go out into the housing market,Claim
were going to have to buy up these bad loans,Claim
were going to have to stabilize home values,Claim
that way americans like alan can realize the american dream and stay in their home,Premise
fannie and freddie were the catalysts the match that started this forest fire,Claim
there were some of us that stood up against it,Premise
there were others who took a hike,Premise
right now the credit markets are frozen up,Premise
small businesses and some large businesses just cant get loans,Premise
if they cant get a loan that means that they cant make payroll,Claim
if they cant make payroll then they may end up having to shut their doors and lay people off,Claim
if you imagine just one company trying to deal with that now imagine a million companies all across the country,Claim
it could end up having an adverse effect on everybody,Premise
we had to take action,Premise
we shouldnt have been there in the first place,Claim
the biggest problem in this whole process was the deregulation of the financial system,Claim
senator mccain as recently as march bragged about the fact that he is a deregulator,Premise
two years ago i said that weve got a subprime lending crisis that has to be dealt with,Premise
nobody did anything about it,Claim
i wrote to secretary paulson,Premise
i wrote to federal reserve chairman bernanke,Premise
told them this is something we have to deal with,Premise
a year ago i went to wall street and said weve got to reregulate and nothing happened,Claim
senator mccain during that period said that we should keep on deregulating,Claim
thats how the free enterprise system works,Premise
with respect to fannie mae what senator mccain didnt mention is the fact that this bill that he talked about wasnt his own bill,Premise
he jumped on it a year after it had been introduced,Premise
it never got passed,Claim
i never promoted fannie mae,Claim
senator mccains campaign chairmans firm was a lobbyist on behalf of fannie mae not me,Claim
youre interested in is trying to figure out how is this going to impact you,Premise
this is not the end of the process,Premise
this is the beginning of the process,Claim
its going to be so important for us to work with homeowners to make sure that they can stay in their homes,Claim
the secretary already has the power to do that in the rescue package,Premise
it hasnt been exercised yet,Claim
the next president has to make sure that the next treasury secretary is thinking about how to strengthen you as a home buyer you as a homeowner,Claim
not simply think about bailing out banks on wall street,Claim
no i am confident about the american economy,Claim
we are going to have to have some leadership from washington that not only sets out much better regulations for the financial system,Claim
the problem is we still have a archaic 20thcentury regulatory system for 21stcentury financial markets,Claim
were going to have to coordinate with other countries to make sure that whatever actions we take work,Claim
were going to have to help ordinary families be able to stay in their homes,Claim
make sure that they can pay their bills,Claim
deal with critical issues like health care and energy,Claim
were going to have to change the culture in washington so that lobbyists and special interests arent driving the process and your voices arent being drowned out,Claim
i think it depends on what we do,Claim
i think if we act effectively if we stabilize the housing market,Claim
which i believe we can if we go out and buy up these bad loans so that people can have a new mortgage at the new value of their home,Claim
i think if we get rid of the cronyism and special interest influence in washington so we can act more effectively,Claim
id like you to see the letter that a group of senators and i wrote warning exactly of this crisis,Premise
senator obamas name was not on that letter,Claim
we can do it,Claim

theyre the most innovative,Premise
i understand your frustration and your cynicism,Claim
while youve been carrying out your responsibilities  most of the people here youve got a family budget,Premise
if less money is coming in you end up making cuts,Claim
maybe you dont go out to dinner as much,Premise
maybe you put off buying a new car,Premise
thats not what happens in washington,Premise
youre right,Claim
there is a lot of blame to go around,Claim
i think its important just to remember a little bit of history,Claim
when george bush came into office we had surpluses,Premise
now we have halfatrilliondollar deficit annually,Claim
when george bush came into office our debt  national debt was around 5 trillion,Premise
its now over 10 trillion,Claim
weve almost doubled it,Premise
so while its true that nobodys completely innocent here we have had over the last eight years the biggest increases in deficit spending and national debt in our history,Claim

weve also got to make spending cuts,Claim
youll hear senator mccain say well hes proposing a whole bunch of new spending,Premise
im cutting more than im spending so that it will be a net spending cut,Claim
the key is whether or not weve got priorities that are working for you as opposed to those who have been dictating the policy in washington lately,Claim
thats mostly lobbyists and special interests,Premise
weve got to put an end to that,Claim
i can see why you feel that cynicism and mistrust,Claim

i have a clear record of bipartisanship,Claim
we need to reform,Claim
senator obama has never taken on his leaders of his party on a single issue,Premise
the situation today cries out for bipartisanship,Premise
thats really part of your mistrust here,Premise
i suggest that maybe you go to some of these organizations that are the watchdogs of what we do like the citizens against government waste or the national taxpayers union or these other organizations that watch us all the time,Premise
i dont expect you to watch every vote,Premise

getting our economy moving again,Claim
drilling offshore and nuclear power are two vital elements of that,Claim

it means that yes we may have to cut some spending,Claim
although i disagree with senator mccain about an acrossthe board freeze,Claim

what we have to do with medicare is have a commission,Claim
have the smartest people in america come together come up with recommendations,Claim
then like the baseclosing commission idea we had,Claim
then we should have congress vote up or down,Claim
senator obama has voted 94 times to either increase your taxes or against tax cuts,Claim
when he ran for the united states senate from illinois he said he would have a middleincome tax cut,Premise

we kept this issue to  to posing to americans the danger that climate change opposes,Premise

this is one of the biggest challenges of our times,Claim

what senator mccain doesnt mention is hes been there 26 of them,Premise

its important for us to understand that it requires a sustained effort from the next president,Claim
its easy to talk about this stuff during a campaign,Premise
we have three percent of the worlds oil reserves and we use 25 percent of the worlds oil,Claim
we cant simply drill our way out of the problem,Claim
were not going to be able to deal with the climate crisis if our only solution is to use more fossil fuels that create global warming,Premise
were going to have to come up with alternatives,Claim
the united states government is working with the private sector to fund the kind of innovation that we can then export to countries like china that also need energy and are setting up one coal power plant a week,Claim
weve got to make sure that were giving them the energy that they need or helping them to create the energy that they need,Claim
i think pure research and development investment on the part of the united states government is certainly appropriate,Claim
i think once it gets into productive stages that we ought to obviously turn it over to the private sector,Claim
we can bridge the gap between imported oil which is a national security issue as well as any other,Claim
it will reduce the price of a barrel of oil,Claim
when people know theres a greater supply then the cost of that will go down,Premise
senator obama has approved storage and reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel,Premise
ill stop,Claim
you didnt even wave,Claim
weve got to drill offshore,Claim
weve got to do it now,Claim
i know you grow a little weary with this backandforth,Claim
it was an energy bill on the floor of the senate loaded down with goodies billions for the oil companies,Claim

i vote against them,Claim
you know who voted for it,Premise
you know who voted against it,Premise
me,Claim
that one,Premise
oil drilling offshore now is vital so that we can bridge the gap,Claim
we have a moral commitment as well as an economic imperative to do something about the health care crisis that so many families are facing,Claim
if youve got health care already and probably the majority of you do then you can keep your plan if you are satisfied with it,Claim
you can keep your choice of doctor,Premise
were going to work with your employer to lower the cost of your premiums by up to 2500 a year,Claim
were going to do it by investing in prevention,Claim
were going to do it by making sure that we use information technology so that medical records are actually on computers instead of you filling forms out in triplicate when you go to the hospital,Claim
that will reduce medical errors and reduce costs,Premise
it is breaking family budgets,Claim
i cant tell you how many people i meet who dont have health insurance,Premise
if youve got health insurance most of you have seen your premiums double over the last eight years,Claim
your copayments and deductibles have gone up 30 percent just in the last year alone,Premise
if youre a small business its a crushing burden,Claim
theres a huge pool we can drop the costs,Premise

which is a huge problem,Premise
if you dont have health insurance youre going to be able to buy the same kind of insurance that senator mccain and i enjoy as federal employees,Claim
hes going to give you a 5000 tax credit,Premise
he is going to tax your employerbased health care benefits for the first time ever,Claim
one hand giveth the other hand taketh away,Premise
he would also strip away the ability of states to provide some of the regulations on insurance companies to make sure youre not excluded for preexisting conditions or your mammograms are covered or your maternity is covered,Claim
that is fundamentally the wrong way to go,Premise
thats something that im committed to doing as president,Premise
just today business organizations like the united states chamber of commerce said that this would lead to the unraveling of the employerbased health care system,Premise
i dont think is the kind of change that we need,Claim
weve got to have somebody who is fighting for patients and making sure that you get decent affordable health care,Claim
we have got to give people choice in america and not mandate things on them and give them the ability,Claim
copayments go up costs go up skyrocketing costs which make people less and less able to afford health insurance in america,Premise
we need to do all of the things that are necessary to make it more efficient,Claim
if youre a small business person and you dont insure your employees senator obama will fine you,Claim
if youre a parent and youre struggling to get health insurance for your children senator obama will fine you,Claim
i want to give every american a 5000 refundable tax credit,Claim
what is at stake here in this health care issue is the fundamental difference between myself and senator obama,Claim
lets put health records online that will reduce medical errors as they call them,Claim
lets have community health centers,Claim
lets have walkin clinics,Claim
lets do a lot of things to impose efficiencies,Claim
he starts saying government will do this and government will do that and then government will,Premise
hell impose mandates,Claim
its ok to go across state lines,Claim
they can take it anywhere across state lines,Claim
why not,Premise
dont we go across state lines when we purchase other things in america,Premise

if you do the math those people who have employerbased health benefits,Premise
if you put the tax on it and you have whats left over and you add 5000 that youre going to get as a refundable tax credit do the math 95 percent of the american people will have increased funds to go out and buy the insurance of their choice and to shop around and to get,Premise
all of those people will be covered except for those who have these goldplated cadillac kinds of policies,Premise
every parent i know would acquire health insurance for their children if they could,Premise
weve got to give them the wherewithal to do it,Claim
we can do it by giving them as a start a 5000 refundable tax credit to go around and get the health insurance policy of their choice,Claim
obviously small business people want to give their employees health insurance,Claim
they all want to do that,Premise
i think its a responsibility,Claim
we should have available and affordable health care to every american citizen to every family member,Claim
with the plan that  that i have that will do that,Premise
government mandates i  im always a little nervous about,Premise
it is certainly my responsibility,Claim
it is certainly smallbusiness people and others,Claim
they certainly are a little nervous when senator obama says if you dont get the health care policy that i think you should have then youre going to get fined,Claim
senator obama has never mentioned how much that fine might be,Premise
perhaps we might find that out tonight,Premise
they understand that responsibility,Claim
american citizens understand that,Premise
employers understand that,Premise
i think it should be a right for every american,Claim
theres something fundamentally wrong about that,Claim
if youve got a health care plan that you like you can keep it,Claim
im going to do is help you to lower the premiums on it,Claim
for us to have people who are going bankrupt because they cant pay their medical bills,Premise
for my mother to die of cancer at the age of 53 and have to spend the last months of her life in the hospital room arguing with insurance companies because theyre saying that this may be a preexisting condition and they dont have to pay her treatment,Premise
i know that were under time constraints,Premise
senator mccain through a lot of stuff out there,Premise

theyve got very  pretty loose laws when it comes to things like credit cards,Premise
small businesses are not going to have a mandate,Premise
theres no mandate involved,Premise
its true that i say that you are going to have to make sure that your child has health care,Claim
children are relatively cheap to insure,Premise
we dont want them going to the emergency room for treatable illnesses like asthma,Premise
when senator mccain says that he wants to provide children health care,Premise
what he doesnt mention is he voted against the expansion of the childrens health insurance program that is responsible for making sure that so many children who didnt have previously health insurance have it now,Claim
ill make on this whole issue of government intrusion and mandates,Claim
it is absolutely true that i think it is important for government to crack down on insurance companies that are cheating their customers that dont give you the fine print,Claim
you end up thinking that youre paying for something and when you finally get sick and you need it youre not getting it,Claim
the reason that its a problem to go shopping state by state,Claim
you know what insurance companies will do,Premise
they will find a state,Claim
where there are no requirements for you to get cancer screenings,Claim
where there are no requirements for you to have to get preexisting conditions,Claim
they will all set up shop there,Claim
thats how in banking it works,Premise
in that situation what happens is is that the protections you have the consumer protections that you need youre not going to have available to you,Claim
we need fundamental change,Claim
it hasnt worked,Claim
thats what weve been going through for the last eight years,Premise
that is a fundamental difference that i have with senator mccain,Premise
he believes in deregulation in every circumstance,Premise
theres no doubt that history shows us that nations that are strong militarily over time have to have a strong economy,Claim
that is one of the challenges that america faces,Premise
america is the greatest force for good in the history of the world,Claim
we have gone to all four corners of the earth and shed american blood in defense usually of somebody elses freedom and our own,Premise
we are peacemakers,Claim
were peacekeepers,Premise
the challenge is to know when the united states of american can beneficially effect the outcome of a crisis,Claim
when to go in and when not,Claim
when american military power is worth the expenditure of our most precious treasure,Claim
that question can only be answered by someone with the knowledge and experience and the judgment,Premise
the judgment to know when our national security is not only at risk,Premise
were a nation of good,Premise
weve done,Claim
where the united states of america can make a difference in preventing genocide,Claim
in preventing the spread of terrorism,Claim
in doing the things that the united states has done not always well,Claim
i am convinced that my record going back to my opposition from sending the marines to lebanon,Claim

we dont have time for onthejob training,Claim
senator mccain in the last debate and today again suggested that i dont understand,Premise
its true,Claim
i dont understand how we ended up invading a country that had nothing to do with 911 while osama bin laden and al qaeda are setting up base camps and safe havens to train terrorists to attack us,Premise
there are some things i dont understand,Premise
that was senator mccains judgment and it was the wrong judgment,Claim
we dont have the resources or the allies to do everything that we should be doing,Premise
when senator mccain was cheerleading the president to go into iraq he suggested it was going to be quick and easy wed be greeted as liberators,Premise
that was the wrong judgment and its been costly to us,Claim
we are a force of good in the world,Claim
there has never been a nation in the history of the world that saw its economy decline and maintained its military superiority,Claim
the respect thats been diminished over the last eight years has constrained us being able to act on something like the genocide in darfur,Claim
the strains that have been placed on our alliances around the world,Claim
thats going to change when im president,Premise
we cant change it unless we fundamentally change senator mccains and george bushs foreign policy,Claim
it has not worked for america,Claim
one of the difficulties with iraq is that it has put an enormous strain first of all on our troops,Premise
its also put an enormous strain on our budget,Claim
weve spent so far close to 700 billion,Premise
if we continue on the path that were on as senator mccain is suggesting its going to go well over 1 trillion,Claim

i do believe that we have to consider it as part of our interests our national interests in intervening where possible,Claim
its so important for us to be able to work in concert with our allies,Claim
right now theres a peacekeeping force that has been set up,Premise
we have african union troops in darfur to stop a genocide that has killed hundreds of thousands of people,Premise
we could be providing logistical support setting up a nofly zone at relatively little cost to us,Claim
we can only do it if we can help mobilize the international community and lead,Claim
thats what i intend to do when im president,Premise
if we could have intervened effectively in the holocaust who among us would say that we had a moral obligation not to go in,Premise
we may not always have national security issues at stake,Premise
we have moral issues at stake,Claim
if we couldve stopped rwanda surely if we had the ability that would be something that we would have to strongly consider and act,Claim
when genocide is happening when ethnic cleansing is happening somewhere around the world and we stand idly by that diminishes us,Premise
were not going to be able to be everywhere all the time,Premise
ill bring them home with victory and with honor,Claim
that requires a cool hand at the tiller,Claim
this requires a person who understands what our  the limits of our capability are,Claim
we have to say never again to a holocaust and never again to rwanda,Claim
the united states of america tom is the greatest force for good,Claim
if we had done what senator obama wanted done in iraq then we would have had a wider war we would have been back iranian influence would have increased al qaeda would have re established a base,Premise
senator obama would have brought our troops home in defeat,Claim
we must do whatever we can to prevent genocide,Claim
whatever we can to prevent these terrible calamities that we have said never again,Claim
it also has to be tempered with our ability to beneficially affect the situation,Claim
we went in to somalia as a peacekeeping organization we ended up trying to be peacemakers and we ended up having to withdraw in humiliation,Premise
the security of your young men and women who are serving in the military are my first priority right after our nations security,Claim
i know those situations,Claim
ive been in them all my life,Premise
we had also better be darn sure we dont leave and make the situation worse,Claim
thereby exacerbating our reputation and our ability to address crises in other parts of the world,Claim
i may have to make those tough decisions,Premise
i wont take them lightly,Premise
in lebanon i stood up to president reagan and said if we send marines in there how can we possibly beneficially affect this situation,Premise
we shouldnt,Premise
almost 300 brave young marines were killed,Premise
you have to temper your decisions with the ability to beneficially affect the situation and realize youre sending americas most precious asset american blood into harms way,Claim

i think its so important for us to reverse course,Claim
thats the central front on terrorism,Premise
i do believe that we have to change our policies with pakistan,Claim
part of the reason i think its so important for us to end the war in iraq is to be able to get more troops into afghanistan,Claim

we will crush al qaida,Claim
that has to be our biggest national security priority,Claim
what ive said is were going to encourage democracy in pakistan expand our nonmilitary aid to pakistan so that they have more of a stake in working with us,Premise
insisting that they go after these militants,Premise
if you are a country and youre trying to gain the support of another country then you want to do everything you can that they would act in a cooperative fashion,Claim

get them to work with us and turn against the cruel taliban and others,Claim
by working and coordinating our efforts together not threatening to attack them,Claim

talk softly,Claim
carry a big stick,Claim
nobody called for the invasion of pakistan,Claim
senator mccain continues to repeat this,Premise
if pakistan is unable or unwilling to hunt down bin laden and take him out then we should,Claim

that i think has to be our policy,Claim
they are threatening to kill more americans,Premise
senator mccain suggests that somehow you know im green behind the ears,Premise

the popular opinion of america had diminished in pakistan,Claim
we were supporting a dictator musharraf had given him 10 billion over seven years and he had suspended civil liberties,Premise
it will change when im president,Claim
we were not promoting democracy,Premise

when i met with president karzai i was very clear that you are going to have to do better by your people in order for us to gain the popular support thats necessary,Premise
i dont think he has to be a dictator,Claim
we want a democracy in afghanistan,Premise
we have to have a government that is responsive to the afghan people and frankly its just not responsive right now,Claim
general petraeus working with the pakistanis working with the afghans doing the same job that he did in iraq will again,Claim
we will succeed and we will bring our troops home with honor and victory and not in defeat,Claim
general petraeus has just taken over a position of responsibility,Premise
he has the command and will really set the tone for the strategy and tactics that are used,Claim
we have to do some things tactically some of which senator obama is correct on,Claim
we have to double the size of the afghan army,Claim
we have to have a streamlined nato command structure,Claim
we have to do a lot of things,Claim

it is the same overall strategy,Claim

weve got to advocate for their membership in nato,Claim
we have to make the russians understand that there are penalties for these this kind of behavior,Claim
this kind of naked aggression into georgia a tiny country and a tiny democracy,Premise
we want to bring international pressures to bear on russia in hopes that that will modify and eventually change their behavior,Premise
the russians must understand that these kinds of actions and activities are not acceptable,Claim
hopefully we will use the leverage economic diplomatic and others united with our allies with our allies and friends in europe who are equally disturbed as we are about their recent behaviors,Premise
the g8 is one of those,Claim
there are many others,Premise

we need it to succeed,Premise
if we suffer defeat in iraq which general petraeus predicts we will,Claim
if we adopted senator obamas set date for withdrawal,Claim
then that will have a calamitous effect in afghanistan and american national security interests in the region,Claim
you might think that with that kind of concern that senator obama would have gone to afghanistan particularly given his responsibilities as a subcommittee chairman,Premise
when im subcommittee chairman we take up the issues under my subcommittee,Premise
i visited afghanistan,Premise
i traveled to waziristan,Premise
i traveled to these places,Premise

i believe the republican guard of iran is a terrorist organization,Claim
we are also going to have to i believe engage in tough direct diplomacy with iran,Claim
we cannot tolerate a nuclear iran,Claim
our policy over the last eight years has not worked,Claim
senator mccain is absolutely right,Premise
our efforts at isolation have actually accelerated their efforts to get nuclear weapons,Claim
that will change when im president of the united states,Claim
this is a major difference i have with senator mccain,Premise
this notion that by not talking to people we are punishing them has not worked,Claim
it has not worked in iran,Premise
it has not worked in north korea,Premise
what senator mccain refers to is a measure in the senate that would try to broaden the mandate inside of iraq,Premise
to deal with iran,Premise
the single thing that has strengthened iran over the last several years has been the war in iraq,Claim
iraq was irans mortal enemy,Claim
weve seen over the last several years is irans influence grow,Claim

giving them more credence in the world arena,Claim
saying theyve probably been doing the right thing,Claim
you will sit down across the table from them and that will legitimize their illegal behavior,Premise
whether it be ronald reagan who wouldnt sit down with brezhnev andropov or chernenko until gorbachev was ready with glasnost and perestroika,Premise
or whether it be nixons trip to china which was preceded by henry kissinger many times before he went,Premise
ill sit down with anybody,Claim
theres got to be preconditions,Claim
those preconditions would apply that we wouldnt legitimize with a face to face meeting a person like ahmadinejad,Claim
ahmadinejad is not the most powerful person in iran,Claim
he may not be the right person to talk to,Premise
i reserve the right as president of the united states to meet with anybody at a time and place of my choosing if i think its going to keep america safe,Claim
senator mccain brought up the history the bipartisan history of us engaging in direct diplomacy,Premise
senator mccain mentioned henry kissinger whos one of his advisers who along with five recent secretaries of state just said that we should meet with iran  guess what  without precondition,Premise
this is one of your own advisers,Premise
understand what this means without preconditions,Premise
it doesnt mean that you invite them over for tea one day,Premise
it means is that we dont do what weve been doing which is to say until you agree to do exactly what we say we wont have direct contacts with you,Claim
theres a difference between preconditions and preparation,Premise
of course weve got to do preparations,Claim
starting with lowlevel diplomatic talks,Premise

iran is a rogue regime,Premise
i was called naive when i suggested that we need to look at exploring contacts with iran,Claim

theyre a member of the axis of evil,Claim
they quadrupled their nuclear capacity,Claim
they tested a nuke,Premise

he said that there could be secretarylevel and lower level meetings,Claim
the iranians have met with ambassador crocker in baghdad,Premise
what senator obama doesnt seem to understand that if without precondition you sit down across the table from someone who has called israel a stinking corpse and wants to destroy that country and wipe it off the map,Claim
this is dangerous,Claim
its dangerous,Claim
it isnt just naive,Premise
as far as north korea is concerned our secretary of state madeleine albright went to north korea,Premise
north korea most repressive and brutal regime probably on earth,Claim
the average south korean is three inches taller than the average north korean a huge gulag,Premise
we dont know what the status of the dear leaders health is today,Premise
we know this that the north koreans have broken every agreement that theyve entered into,Claim
we ought to go back to a little bit of ronald reagans trust but verify and certainly not sit down across the table from  without precondition as senator obama said he did twice,Premise
its just dangerous,Claim
senator mccain keeps on using this example that suddenly the president would just meet with somebody without doing any preparation without having lowlevel talks,Claim
nobodys been talking about that and senator mccain knows it,Premise
this is a mischaracterization of my position,Premise
the notion that we would sit with ahmadinejad and not say anything while hes spewing his nonsense and his vile comments is ridiculous,Claim
the idea is that we do not expect to solve every problem before we initiate talks,Premise
the bush administration has come to recognize that it hasnt worked this notion that we are simply silent when it comes to our enemies,Claim
nobody is even talking about that,Premise
senator obama is parsing words when he says precondition means preparation,Claim
i am not parsing words,Claim
he encourages and other people encourage contacts and negotiations and all other things,Claim
we do that all the time,Premise
hes parsing words,Claim
im using the same words that your advisers use,Claim
i think that given whats happened over the last several weeks and months our entire russian approach has to be evaluated,Claim
a resurgent and very aggressive russia is a threat to the peace and stability of the region,Premise
their actions in georgia were unacceptable,Claim
they were unwarranted,Premise
it is absolutely critical for the next president to make clear that we have to follow through on our sixparty  or the sixpoint ceasefire,Claim
they have to remove themselves from south ossetia and abkhazia,Claim
it is absolutely important that we have a unified alliance and that we explain to the russians that you cannot be a 21stcentury superpower or power and act like a 20thcentury dictatorship,Claim
we also have to affirm all the fledgling democracies in that region,Claim
the estonians the lithuanians the latvians the poles the czechs,Premise
that we are in fact going to be supportive and in solidarity with them in their efforts,Claim
they are members of nato,Premise
countries like georgia and the ukraine,Premise
i think we have to insist that they are free to join nato if they meet the requirements,Claim
they should have a membership action plan immediately to start bringing them in,Claim
we also cant return to a cold war posture with respect to russia,Claim
we recognize there are going to be some areas of common interest,Premise
one is nuclear proliferation,Claim
they have not only 15000 nuclear warheads,Premise
theyve got enough to make another 40000,Claim
some of those loose nukes could fall into the hands of al qaida,Premise
this is an area where ive led on in the senate working with a republican ranking member of the senate foreign relations committee dick lugar to deal with the proliferation of loose nuclear weapons,Premise
we have to have a president who is clear that you dont deal with russia based on staring into his eyes and seeing his soul,Claim
thats an area where were going to have to work with russia,Claim
we have to recognize that the way theyve been behaving lately demands a sharp response from the international community and our allies,Claim
i was interested in senator obamas reaction to the russian aggression against georgia,Premise
i am sure that that will not happen,Claim
i do believe that we need to bolster our friends and allies,Claim
his first statement was both sides ought to show restraint,Premise
a little bit of naivete there,Claim
he doesnt understand that russia committed serious aggression against georgia,Claim
russia has now become a nation fueled by petrodollars that is basically a kgb apparatchikrun government,Premise
i dont believe were going to go back to the cold war,Premise
their aggression in georgia is not acceptable behavior,Claim
that wasnt just about a problem between georgia and russia,Premise
it had everything to do with energy,Claim
theres a pipeline that runs from the caspian through georgia through turkey,Claim
we know that the russians control other sources of energy into europe,Claim
which they have used from time to time,Premise
its not accidental that the presidents of latvia estonia lithuania poland and ukraine flew to georgia flew to tbilisi,Premise
they showed solidarity with them,Premise
they are very concerned about the russian threats to regain their status of the old russian to regain their status of the old russian empire,Claim
i think the russians ought to understand that we will support  we the united states  will support the inclusion of georgia and ukraine in the natural process inclusion into nato,Claim
we also ought to make it very clear that the russians are in violation of their ceasefire agreement,Claim
they have stationed additional troops in abkhazia and south ossetia,Premise
this is a very difficult situation,Premise
we want to work with the russians,Claim
it was very clear the russian intentions towards georgia,Claim
they were just waiting to seize the opportunity,Claim
there was a huge poster of vladimir putin and it said vladimir putin our president,Premise
we also have every right to expect the russians to behave in a fashion and keeping with a  with a  with a country who respects international boundaries and the norms of international behavior,Claim
this whole thing has got a lot to do with ukraine crimea the base of the russian fleet in sevastopol,Premise
the breakdown of the political process in ukraine between tymoshenko and yushchenko is a very serious problem,Claim
lets make sure that we  that the ukrainians understand that we are their friend and ally,Premise
i think senator mccain and i agree for the most part on these issues,Premise
i disagree with this notion that somehow we did not forcefully object to russians going into georgia,Claim
i immediately said that this was illegal and objectionable,Premise
i wanted a cessation of the violence,Claim
it put an enormous strain on georgia,Premise
i was the first to say that we have to rebuild the georgian economy and called for a billion dollars that has now gone in to help them rebuild,Premise
russias intentions here was to weaken the economy to the point where president saakashvili was so weakened that he might be replaced by somebody that putin favored more,Claim
we have to have foresight and anticipate some of these problems,Claim
russia is in part resurgent and putin is feeling powerful,Claim
i warned the administration that you had russian peacekeepers in georgian territory,Premise
we needed to do was replace them with international peacekeepers and a special envoy to resolve the crisis before it boiled over,Claim
that wasnt done,Premise
had it been done its possible we could have avoided the issue,Claim
senator mccain and i i think agree on the importance of energy,Premise
over 26 years senator mccain voted 23 times against alternative energy like solar and wind and biodiesel,Premise
that means that we as one of the biggest consumers of oil  25 percent of the worlds oil  have to have an energy strategy not just to deal with russia,Premise
to deal with many of the rogue states weve talked about iran venezuela,Claim
increasing domestic production and offshore drilling,Claim
we only have 3 percent of the worlds oil supplies,Premise
we use 25 percent of the worlds oil,Claim
we cant simply drill our way out of the problem,Premise
what were going to have to do is to approach it through alternative energy like solar and wind and biodiesel and yes nuclear energy cleancoal technology,Claim
ive got a plan for us to make a significant investment over the next 10 years to do that,Claim
weve got to walk the walk and not just talk the talk when it comes to energy independence,Claim
this is probably going to be just as vital for our economy,Premise
the pain that people are feeling at the pump as it is our national security and the issue of climate change thats so important,Premise
no one from arizona is against solar,Claim
senator obama says hes for nuclear,Premise
hes against reprocessing and hes against storing,Premise
thats just not true,Claim
thats not true,Claim
offshore drilling is also something that is very important and it is a bridge,Claim
if we drill offshore and exploit a lot of these reserves it will help at temporarily relieve our energy requirements,Premise
it will have i think an important effect on the price of a barrel of oil,Claim
i supported nunnlugar back in the early 1990s when a lot of my colleagues didnt,Claim
that was the key legislation at the time and put us on the road to eliminating this issue of nuclear waste and the nuclear fuel that has to be taken care of,Premise
i have never said that i object to nuclear waste,Claim
ive said is that we have to store it safely,Claim
i have voted for alternate fuel all of my time,Claim
no one can be opposed to alternate energy,Claim
youve got one more energy,Claim
i think its much less than it was the day after 911,Claim
we have a safer nation,Claim
we are a long way from safe,Claim
i have worked across the aisle,Premise
i have a long record on that on a long series of reforms,Premise
911 senator joe lieberman and i decided that we needed a commission,Premise
a commission to investigate 911 and find out what happened and fix it,Premise
i know our allies,Premise
i can work much more closely with them,Claim
i think america is safer today than it was on 911,Claim
we were opposed by the administration,Premise
we were stymied until the families of 911 came,Premise
they descended on washington,Premise
we got that legislation passed,Claim
there were a series of recommendations as i recall more than 40,Claim
weve gotten written into law most of those reforms recommended by that commission,Claim
im proud of that work again bipartisan reaching across the aisle working together democrat and republican alike,Premise
we have a long way to go in our intelligence services,Claim
we have to do a better job in human intelligence,Claim
weve got to  to make sure that we have people who are trained interrogators so that we dont ever torture a prisoner ever again,Claim
we have to make sure that our technological and intelligence capabilities are better,Claim
we have to work more closely with our allies,Claim
that doesnt mean that we dont have a long way to go,Claim
i think that those men and women in those agencies are doing a great job,Claim
we still have a long way to go before we can declare america safe,Claim
that means doing a better job along our borders as well,Premise
weve probably had the largest reorganization of government since we established the defense department,Claim
i think that we are safer in some ways,Claim
obviously weve poured billions of dollars into airport security,Premise
we have done some work in terms of securing potential targets,Premise
we still have a long way to go,Claim
we need missile defense,Claim
because of iran and north korea and the potential for them to obtain or to launch nuclear weapons,Premise
when we are only spending a few hundred million dollars on nuclear proliferation then were making a mistake,Claim
the other thing that we have to focus on though is al qaida,Claim
weve got to make sure that were hardening our chemical sites,Claim
we havent done enough in terms of transit,Premise
we havent done enough in terms of ports,Premise
the biggest threat that we face right now is not a nuclear missile coming over the skies,Claim
its in a suitcase,Claim
this is why the issue of nuclear proliferation is so important,Premise
the biggest threat to the united states is a terrorist getting their hands on nuclear weapons,Claim
we are spending billions of dollars on missile defense,Claim
they are now operating in 60 countries,Claim
we cant simply be focused on iraq,Premise
we have to go to the root cause and that is in afghanistan and pakistan,Claim
thats going to be critical,Premise
we are going to need more cooperation with our allies,Premise
it is important for us to understand that the way we are perceived in the world is going to make a difference in terms of our capacity to get cooperation and root out terrorism,Claim
i intend to do as president is to restore americas standing in the world,Claim
we are less respected now than we were eight years ago or even four years ago,Premise
this is the greatest country on earth,Claim
because of some of the mistakes that have been made,Premise
because of those things,Premise
we i think are going to have a lot of work to do in the next administration to restore that sense that america is that shining beacon on a hill,Claim
i give senator mccain great credit on the torture issue for having identified that as something that undermines our longterm security,Premise
i think americans will judge very seriously as to whether thats the right path or the wrong path and who should be the next president of the united states,Claim
in the case of missile defense senator obama said it had to be quote proven,Premise
that wasnt proven when ronald reagan said we would do sdi which is missile defense,Claim
it was major  a major factor in bringing about the end of the cold war,Claim
senator obama still doesnt quite understand  or doesnt get it  that if we fail in iraq it encourages al qaida,Claim
they would establish a base in iraq,Premise
the consequences of defeat which would result from his plan of withdrawal,Claim
according to date certain regardless of conditions according to our military leaders according to every expert would lead to defeat,Claim
possible defeat loss of all the fragile sacrifice that weve made of american blood and treasure which grieves us all,Claim
all of that would be lost if we followed senator obamas plan to have specific dates with withdrawal regardless of conditions on the ground,Claim
general petraeus says we have had great success,Premise
its very fragile,Claim
we cant do what senator obama wants to do,Claim
that is the central issue of our time,Premise
theres no doubt,Claim
we have weakened our capacity to project power around the world,Claim
we have viewed everything through this single lens,Premise
we are now spending 10 billion or more every month,Premise
we cant provide health care to people who need it,Claim
we cant invest in science and technology,Claim
which will determine whether or not we are going to be competitive in the long term,Premise
over the last eight years this administration along with senator mccain have been solely focused on iraq,Claim
bin laden is still out there,Claim
al qaida is resurgent,Claim
weve got challenges for example with china where we are borrowing billions of dollars,Claim
they now hold a trillion dollars worth of our debt,Claim
they are active in countries like  in regions like latin america and asia and africa,Premise
they are  the conspicuousness of their presence is only matched by our absence,Claim
weve been focused on iraq,Premise
he is not killed,Premise
he is not captured,Premise
that has been where all our resources have gone,Premise
that has been their priority,Premise
there has never been a country on earth that saw its economy decline and yet maintained its military superiority,Claim
this is a national security issue,Claim
what we are talking about is recognizing that the next president has to have a broader strategic vision about all the challenges that we face,Claim
that sense is something that i want to restore,Premise
thats been missing over the last eight years,Claim
we havent adequately funded veterans care,Claim
weve got  i meet veterans all across the country who are trying to figure out how can i get disability payments,Premise
i cant get treatment  so we have put all chips in right there and nobody is talking about losing this war,Premise
i honestly dont believe that senator obama has the knowledge or experience and has made the wrong judgments in a number of areas,Claim
weve seen this stubbornness before in this administration to cling to a belief that somehow the surge has not succeeded and failing to acknowledge that he was wrong about the surge,Claim
we need more flexibility in a president of the united states than that,Claim
i dont think i need any onthejob training,Claim
im ready to go at it right now,Premise
i have the ability and the knowledge and the background to make the right judgments to keep this country safe and secure,Claim
reform prosperity and peace these are major challenges to the united states of america,Premise
my father came from kenya,Premise
thats where i get my name,Premise
i dont think any of us can say that our standing in the world now the way children around the world look at the united states is the same,Claim
in the 60s he wrote letter after letter to come to college here in the united states,Claim
the notion was that there was no other country on earth where you could make it if you tried,Premise
the ideals and the values of the united states inspired the entire world,Claim
to send a message to the world that we are going to invest in issues like education,Claim
we are going to invest in issues that  that relate to how ordinary people are able to live out their dreams,Claim
this is part of our judgment this is part of how were going to keep america safe,Premise
what we need to do,Premise
what the next president has to do,Premise

the auto industry has come roaring back,Premise
housing has begun to rise,Premise
we all know that weve still got a lot of work to do,Premise
i think weve got to invest in education and training,Claim
governor romney has a perspective that says if we cut taxes skewed towards the wealthy and roll back regulations that well be better off,Premise
ive got a different view,Premise
i think its important for us to develop new sources of energy here in america,Claim
that we change our tax code to make sure that were helping small businesses and companies that are investing here in the united states,Claim
that we take some of the money that were saving as we wind down two wars to rebuild america,Claim
that we reduce our deficit in a balanced way that allows us to make these critical investments,Claim
yes we can help but its going to take a different path,Claim
this is obviously a very tender topic,Premise
ive had the occasion over the last couple of years of meeting people across the country,Premise
i was in dayton ohio and a woman grabbed my arm and she said ive been out of work since may can you help me,Premise

there will be no tax cut that adds to the deficit,Claim
im not looking to cut massive taxes and to reduce the  the revenues going to the government,Claim
no tax cut that adds to the deficit,Claim
i do want to reduce the burden being paid by middleincome americans,Premise
i cannot reduce the burden paid by highincome americans,Claim
thats exactly what i did,Claim
lets talk about taxes,Claim
its instructive,Premise
four years ago when i stood on this stage i said that i would cut taxes for middleclass families,Premise
we cut taxes for middleclass families by about 3600,Premise
i believe that we do best when the middle class is doing well,Premise
by giving them those tax cuts they had a little more money in their pocket and so maybe they can buy a new car,Premise
they are certainly in a better position to weather the extraordinary recession that we went through,Claim
they can buy a computer for their kid whos going off to college,Premise
which means theyre spending more money businesses have more customers businesses make more profits and then hire more workers,Premise
the problem is that hes been asked over 100 times how you would close those deductions and loopholes and he hasnt been able to identify them,Claim
governor romneys proposal that he has been promoting for 18 months calls for a 5 trillion tax cut on top of 2 trillion of additional spending for our military,Claim
he is saying that he is going to pay for it by closing loopholes and deductions,Premise
when you add up all the loopholes and deductions that upperincome individuals can  are currently taking advantage of you take those all away you dont come close to paying for 5 trillion in tax cuts and 2 trillion in additional military spending,Claim
independent studies looking at this said the only way to meet governor romneys pledge of not reducing the deficit or  or  or not adding to the deficit is by burdening middleclass families,Premise
the average middleclass family with children would pay about 2000 more,Premise
thats not my analysis,Premise
thats the analysis of economists who have looked at this,Premise
that kind of top  topdown economics where folks at the top are doing well so the average person making 3 million is getting a 250000 tax break while middleclass families are burdened further thats not what i believe is a recipe for economic growth,Claim
virtually everything he just said about my tax plan is inaccurate,Claim
if the tax plan he described were a tax plan i was asked to support id say absolutely not,Claim
im not looking for a 5 trillion tax cut,Claim
i wont put in place a tax cut that adds to the deficit,Claim
theres no economist that can say mitt romneys tax plan adds 5 trillion if i say i will not add to the deficit with my tax plan,Premise
i will not reduce the share paid by highincome individuals,Claim
its just not the case,Claim
its a popular thing to say with a lot of people,Premise
you and your running mate keep saying that,Premise
i will not reduce the taxes paid by highincome americans,Claim
ive got five boys,Premise
im used to people saying something thats not always true but just keep on repeating it and ultimately hoping ill believe it,Premise
that is not the case,Claim
i will not under any circumstances raise taxes on middleincome families,Claim
i will lower taxes on middleincome families,Claim
you cite a study,Premise
there are six other studies that looked at the study you describe and say its completely wrong,Premise
i saw a study that came out today that said youre going to raise taxes by 3000 to 4000 on middleincome families,Premise
there are all these studies out there,Premise
i want to bring down rates,Claim
i want to bring the rates down at the same time lower deductions and exemptions and credits and so forth,Claim
so we keep getting the revenue we need,Premise
small business pays that individual rate 54 percent of americas workers work in businesses that are taxed not at the corporate tax rate but at the individual tax rate,Premise
they will be able to hire more people,Claim
if we lower that rate,Premise
this is about jobs,Claim
this is about getting jobs for the american people,Claim
what i want to do is continue the tax rates  the tax cuts that we put into place for small businesses and families,Claim
for incomes over 250000 a year that we should go back to the rates that we had when bill clinton was president,Claim
when we created 23 million new jobs went from deficit to surplus and created a whole lot of millionaires to boot,Premise
this is important,Claim
by doing that we cannot only reduce the deficit we cannot only encourage job growth through small businesses but were also able to make the investments that are necessary in education or in energy,Premise
it is not possible to come up with enough deductions and loopholes that only affect highincome individuals to avoid either raising the deficit or burdening the middle class,Claim
its math,Premise
its arithmetic,Premise
for 18 months hes been running on this tax plan,Premise
now five weeks before the election hes saying that his big bold idea is never mind,Premise
if you are lowering the rates the way you described,Premise
under my plan 97 percent of small businesses would not see their income taxes go up,Claim
governor romney says well those top 3 percent theyre the job creators theyd be burdened,Premise
but under governor romneys definition there are a whole bunch of millionaires and billionaires who are small businesses,Premise
donald trump is a small business,Premise
i know donald trump doesnt like to think of himself as small anything,Premise
thats how you define small businesses if youre getting business income,Claim
that kind of approach i believe will not grow our economy,Claim
the only way to pay for it without either burdening the middle class or blowing up our deficit is to make drastic cuts in things like education making sure that we are continuing to invest in basic science and research all the things that are helping america grow,Premise
i think that would be a mistake,Claim
my priority is jobs,Claim
i dont want to cost jobs,Claim
i bring down the tax rates,Claim
lower deductions and exemptions the same idea behind bowlessimpson by the way get the rates down lower deductions and exemptions to create more jobs,Claim
theres nothing better for getting us to a balanced budget than having more people working earning more money paying more taxes,Premise
thats by far the most effective and efficient way to get this budget balanced,Claim
your plan is to take the tax rate on successful small businesses from 35 percent to 40 percent,Claim
the national federation of independent businesses has said that will cost 700000 jobs,Premise
it added up to well over 50 percent of what they earned,Premise
he said he and his son calculated how much they pay in taxes federal income tax federal payroll tax state income tax state sales tax state property tax gasoline tax,Premise
he has four employees,Premise
hes in the electronics business in  in st louis,Premise
ive talked to a guy who has a very small business,Premise
your plan is to take their tax rate from 35 percent to 40 percent,Claim
those are the businesses that employ onequarter of all the workers in america,Premise
those businesses that are in the last 3 percent of businesses happen to employ half  half of all the people who work in small business,Premise
governor romneys plan may work for you,Claim
if you believe that we can cut taxes by 5 trillion and add 2 trillion in additional spending that the military is not asking for 7 trillion  just to give you a sense over 10 years thats more than our entire defense budget  and you think that by closing loopholes and deductions for the welltodo somehow you will not end up picking up the tab,Premise
i think math common sense and our history shows us thats not a recipe for job growth,Claim
weve tried this,Premise
weve tried both approaches,Premise
the approach that governor romneys talking about is the same sales pitch that was made in 2001 and 2003,Premise
we ended up with the slowest job growth in 50 years,Premise
we ended up moving from surplus to deficits,Premise
it all culminated in the worst financial crisis since the great depression,Premise
bill clinton tried the approach that im talking about,Premise
we created 23 million new jobs,Premise
we went from deficit to surplus,Premise
businesses did very well,Premise
in some ways weve got some data on which approach is more likely to create jobs and opportunity for americans,Premise
i believe that the economy works best when middleclass families are getting tax breaks so that theyve got some money in their pockets,Claim
those of us who have done extraordinarily well because of this magnificent country that we live in that we can afford to do a little bit more to make sure were not blowing up the deficit,Claim
im not in favor of a 5 trillion tax cut,Claim
thats not my plan,Claim
my plan is not to put in place any tax cut that will add to the deficit,Claim
thats not my plan,Claim
my plan is not like anything thats been tried before,Claim
my plan is to bring down rates,Claim
also bring down deductions and exemptions and credits at the same time so the revenue stays in but that we bring down rates to get more people working,Claim
my priority is putting people back to work in america,Claim
theyre suffering in this country,Premise
going forward with the status quo is not going to cut it for the american people who are struggling today,Claim
look at the evidence of the last four years,Premise
its absolutely extraordinary,Premise
weve got 23 million people out of work or stopped looking for work in this country,Premise
its just  its  weve got  when the president took office 32 million people on food stamps,Premise
47 million on food stamps today economic growth this year slower than last year and last year slower than the year before,Premise
i think its not just an economic issue,Claim
i think its a moral issue,Claim
i think its frankly not moral for my generation to keep spending massively more than we take in,Claim
knowing those burdens are going to be passed on to the next generation and theyre going to be paying the interest and the principal all their lives,Premise
the amount of debt were adding at a trillion a year is simply not moral,Claim
mathematically there are three ways that you can cut a deficit,Claim
one of course is to raise taxes,Premise
number two is to cut spending,Premise
ill take programs that are currently good programs but i think could be run more efficiently at the state level and send them to the state,Claim
ill make government more efficient and to cut back the number of employees combine some agencies and departments,Claim
my cutbacks will be done through attrition,Claim
number is to grow the economy,Premise
if more people work in a growing economy theyre paying taxes and you can get the job done that way,Premise
the presidents would  president would prefer raising taxes,Claim
the problem with raising taxes is that it slows down the rate of growth,Premise
you could never quite get the job done,Claim
i want to lower spending and encourage economic growth at the same time,Claim
i will eliminate all programs by this test if they dont pass it is the program so critical its worth borrowing money from china to pay for it,Claim
if not ill get rid of it,Claim
obamacares on my list,Premise
ill get rid of that,Claim
im going to stop the subsidy to pbs,Claim
im going to stop other things,Claim
im not going to keep on spending money on things to borrow money from china to pay for,Claim
this is the approach we have to take to get america to a balanced budget,Claim
the president said hed cut the deficit in half,Premise
unfortunately he doubled it,Premise
trilliondollar deficits for the last four years,Premise
the presidents put it in place as much public debt  almost as much debt held by the public as al prior presidents combined,Premise
when i walked into the oval office i had more than a trilliondollar deficit greeting me,Premise
we know where it came from two wars that were paid for on a credit card two tax cuts that were not paid for and a whole bunch of programs that were not paid for and then a massive economic crisis,Claim
what weve also said is lets make sure that we are cutting out those things that are not helping us grow,Premise
despite that what weve said is yes we had to take some initial emergency measures to make sure we didnt slip into a great depression,Premise
77 government programs everything from aircrafts that the air force had ordered but werent working very well 18 government  18 government programs for education that were wellintentioned not werent helping kids learn,Premise
we went after medical fraud in medicare and medicaid very aggressively more aggressively than ever before and have saved tens of billions of dollars 50 billion of waste taken out of the system,Premise
i worked with democrats and republicans to cut a trillion dollars out of our discretionary domestic budget,Premise
thats the largest cut in the discretionary domestic budget since dwight eisenhower,Premise
weve got to do more,Claim
ive put forward a specific 4 trillion deficit reduction plan,Claim
its on a website,Premise
you can look at all the numbers what cuts we make and what revenue we raise,Premise
the way we do it is 250 for every cut we ask for 1 of additional revenue paid for as i indicated earlier by asking those of us who have done very well in this country to contribute a little bit more to reduce the deficit,Premise
governor romney earlier mentioned the bowlessimpson commission,Premise
thats how the commission  bipartisan commission that talked about how we should move forward suggested we have to do it in a balanced way with some revenue and some spending cuts,Premise
when governor romney stood on a stage with other republican candidates for the nomination and he was asked would you take 10 of spending cuts for just 1 of revenue,Premise
he said no,Premise
if you take such an unbalanced approach then that means you are going to be gutting our investments in schools and education,Claim
it means that governor romney talked about medicaid and how we could send it back to the states,Premise
effectively this means a 30 percent cut in the primary program we help for seniors who are in nursing homes for kids who are with disabilities,Claim
that is not a right strategy for us to move forward,Claim
simpsonbowles the president should have grabbed that,Claim
i have my own plan,Claim
its not the same as simpson bowles,Premise
in my view the president should have grabbed it,Claim
if you wanted to make some adjustments to it take it go to congress fight for it,Claim
thats what weve done made some adjustments to it and were putting it forward before congress right now a 4 trillion plan,Claim
youve been president four years,Premise
you said youd cut the deficit in half,Premise
its now four years later,Premise
we still have trilliondollar deficits,Premise
the cbo says well have a trilliondollar deficit each of the next four years,Premise
if youre reelected well get to a trilliondollar debt,Claim
you have said before youd cut the deficit in half,Premise
i love this idea of 4 trillion in cuts,Premise
you found 4 trillion of ways to reduce or to get closer to a balanced budget except we still show trilliondollar deficits every year,Premise
that doesnt get the job done,Claim
you said look im going to extend the tax policies that we have now im not going to raise taxes on anyone because when the economy is growing slow like this when were in recession you shouldnt raise taxes on anyone,Premise
the economy is still growing slow,Premise
its growing much more slowly now than when you made that statement,Premise
you just dont want to raise taxes on people,Claim
if you believe the same thing,Premise
the reality is its not just wealthy people,Claim
you mentioned donald trump,Premise
its not just donald trump youre taxing,Claim
its all those businesses that employ onequarter of the workers in america,Claim
these small businesses that are taxed as individuals,Premise
you raise taxes and you kill jobs,Claim
the national federation of independent businesses said your plan will kill 700000 jobs,Premise
i dont want to kill jobs in this environment,Claim
weve got to take a balanced responsible approach,Claim
if were serious,Premise
there has to be revenue in addition to cuts,Claim
governor romney has ruled out revenue,Premise
hes ruled out revenue,Premise
absolutely,Claim
the revenue i get is by more people working getting higher pay paying more taxes,Premise
thats how we get growth and how we balance the budget,Claim
the idea of taxing people more putting more people out of work youll never get there,Claim
youll never balance the budget by raising taxes,Claim
spain spends 42 percent of their total economy on government,Premise
were now spending 42 percent of our economy on government,Premise
i dont want to go down the path to spain,Claim
i want to go down the path of growth that puts americans to work with more money coming in because theyre working,Claim
ive identified areas where we can right away make a change that i believe would actually help the economy,Claim
this is not just when it comes to individual taxes,Claim
lets talk about corporate taxes,Claim
the oil industry gets 4 billion a year in corporate welfare,Premise
basically they get deductions that those small businesses that governor romney refers to they dont get,Premise
does anybody think that exxonmobil needs some extra money when theyre making money every time you go to the pump,Premise
why wouldnt we want to eliminate that,Premise
why wouldnt we eliminate tax breaks for corporate jets,Premise
if you got a corporate jet you can probably afford to pay full freight not get a special break for it,Claim
i want to do the same thing,Claim
ive actually identified how we can do that,Claim
when it comes to corporate taxes governor romney has said he wants to in a revenue neutral way close loopholes deductions  he hasnt identified which ones they are  but that thereby bring down the corporate rate,Premise
part of the way to do it is to not give tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas,Claim
right now you can actually take a deduction for moving a plant overseas,Premise
i think most americans would say that doesnt make sense,Claim
all that raises revenue,Premise
what that then allows us to do is also to help young people make sure that they can afford to go to college,Claim
the way we already have during my administration,Premise
if we take a balanced approach,Premise
it means that the teacher that i met in las vegas a wonderful young lady who describes to me  shes got 42 kids in her class,Premise
the first two weeks shes got them some of them sitting on the floor until finally they get reassigned,Premise
theyre using text books that are 10 years old,Premise
that is not a recipe for growth,Claim
thats not how america was built,Premise
budgets reflect choices,Claim
were going to have to make some decisions,Premise
weve got to get rid of a whole bunch of stuff,Claim
if were asking for no revenue,Premise
the magnitude of the tax cuts that youre talking about governor would end up resulting in severe hardship for people but more importantly would not help us grow,Claim
as i indicated before when you talk about shifting medicaid to states were talking about potentially a 30  a 30 percent cut in medicaid over time,Premise
that may not seem like a big deal when it just is you know numbers on a sheet of paper,Premise
thats a big problem,Claim
if were talking about a family whos got an autistic kid and is depending on that medicaid,Premise
governors are creative,Premise
theres no doubt about it,Premise
theyre not creative enough to make up for 30 percent of revenue on something like medicaid,Claim
what ends up happening is some people end up not getting help,Claim
its time to end it,Claim
this is not the kind of policy you want to have,Claim
if you want to get america energy secure,Premise
the idea that you get a break for shipping jobs overseas is simply not the case,Claim
the department of energy has said the tax break for oil companies is 28 billion a year,Premise
its actually an accounting treatment as you know thats been in place for a hundred years,Premise
this 28 billion goes largely to small companies to drilling operators and so forth,Claim
in one year you provided 90 billion in breaks to the green energy world,Premise
i like green energy as well but thats about 50 years worth of what oil and gas receives,Premise
if we get that tax rate from 35 percent down to 25 percent why that 28 billion is on the table,Premise
of course its on the table,Premise
thats probably not going to survive you get that rate down to 25 percent,Premise
dont forget you put 90 billion like 50 years worth of breaks into  into solar and wind to solyndra and fisker and tester and ener1,Premise
the second topic which is you said you get a deduction for taking a plant overseas,Premise
ive been in business for 25 years,Premise
i have no idea what youre talking about,Premise
id like to bring money from overseas back to this country,Claim
i would like to take the medicaid dollars that go to states and say to a state youre going to get what you got last year plus inflation plus 1 percent and then youre going to manage your care for your poor in the way you think best,Claim
i remember as a governor when this idea was floated by tommy thompson the governors  republican and democrats  said please let us do that,Premise
we can care for our own poor in so much better and more effective a way than having the federal government tell us how to care for our poor,Premise
one of the magnificent things about this country is the whole idea that states are the laboratories of democracy,Premise
dont have the federal government tell everybody what kind of training programs they have to have and what kind of medicaid they have to have,Claim
let states do this,Claim
if a state gets in trouble well we can step in and see if we can find a way to help them,Premise
the right approach is one which relies on the brilliance of our people and states not the federal government,Claim
i suspect that on social security weve got a somewhat similar position,Claim
social security is structurally sound,Premise
its going to have to be tweaked the way it was by ronald reagan and speaker  democratic speaker tip oneill,Claim
the basic structure is sound,Premise
thats the big driver of our deficits right now,Claim
thats the perspective i bring when i think about whats called entitlements,Claim
the reason she could be independent was because of social security and medicare,Claim
she had worked all her life put in this money and understood that there was a basic guarantee a floor under which she could not go,Premise
she ended up living alone by choice,Premise
she worked her way up,Premise
only had a high school education started as a secretary ended up being the vice president of a local bank,Premise
she was fiercely independent,Premise
my grandmother died three days before i was elected president,Premise
my grandfather died a while back,Premise
my grandparents did,Premise
you know my grandmother  some of you know  helped to raise me,Premise
the name itself implies some sense of dependency on the part of these folks,Premise
these are folks whove worked hard like my grandmother,Premise
there are millions of people out there who are counting on this,Premise
the way for us to deal with medicare in particular is to lower health care costs,Claim
you dont need a major structural change in order to make sure that social security is there for the future,Claim
we were also able to make a  make a significant dent in providing them the kind of preventive care that will ultimately save money through the  throughout the system,Premise
using that money we were actually able to lower prescription drug costs for seniors by an average of 600,Premise
716 billion we were able to save from the medicare program by no longer overpaying insurance companies by making sure that we werent overpaying providers,Premise
in medicare what we did was we said we are going to have to bring down the costs if were going to deal with our longterm deficits but to do that lets look where some of the moneys going,Premise
my approach is to say how do we strengthen the system over the long term,Claim
anytime we talk about entitlements people become concerned that somethings going to happen thats going to change their life for the worse,Claim
our seniors depend on these programs,Premise
neither the president nor i are proposing any changes for any current retirees or near retirees either to social security or medicare,Claim
if youre 60 or around 60 or older you dont need to listen any further,Claim
for younger people we need to talk about what changes are going to be occurring,Claim
i was wrong when i said the president isnt proposing any changes for current retirees,Claim
in fact he is on medicare,Premise
on social security hes not,Premise
on medicare for current retirees hes cutting 716 billion from the program,Premise
he says by not overpaying hospitals and providers,Premise
just going to them and saying were going to reduce the rates you get paid across the board everybodys going to get a lower rate,Premise
thats not just going after places where theres abuse,Claim
thats saying were cutting the rates,Claim
some 15 percent of hospitals and nursing homes say they wont take anymore medicare patients under that scenario,Premise
we also have 50 percent of doctors who say they wont take more medicare patients,Premise
we have 4 million people on medicare advantage that will lose medicare advantage,Claim
because of those 716 billion in cuts,Premise
you point out well were putting some back were going to give a better prescription program,Premise
thats 1  thats 1 for every 15 youve cut,Premise
theyre smart enough to know thats not a good trade,Premise
i want to take that 716 billion youve cut and put it back into medicare,Claim
we can include a prescription program if we need to improve it,Claim
the idea of cutting 716 billion from medicare to be able to balance the additional cost of obamacare is in my opinion a mistake,Claim
with regards to young people coming along ive got proposals to make sure medicare and social security are there for them without any question,Claim
i think its important for governor romney to present this plan that he says will only affect folks in the future,Claim
the essence of the plan is that you would turn medicare into a voucher program,Claim
its called premium support,Premise
its understood to be a voucher program,Premise
i dont,Claim
the idea which was originally presented by congressman ryan your running mate is that we would give a voucher to seniors and they could go out in the private marketplace and buy their own health insurance,Premise
this would cost the average senior about 6000 a year,Claim
because the voucher wouldnt necessarily keep up with health care inflation,Premise
in fairness what governor romney has now said is hell maintain traditional medicare alongside it,Premise
theres still a problem,Claim
what happens is those insurance companies are pretty clever at figuring out who are the younger and healthier seniors,Premise
they recruit them leaving the older sicker seniors in medicare,Premise
every health care economist that looks at it says over time whatll happen is the traditional medicare system will collapse,Premise
i dont think vouchers are the right way to go,Claim
what youve got is folks like my grandmother at the mercy of the private insurance system precisely at the time when they are most in need of decent health care,Premise
this is not my own  only my opinion,Claim
aarp thinks that the  the savings that we obtained from medicare bolster the system lengthen the medicare trust fund by eight years,Premise
benefits were not affected at all,Premise
ironically if you repeal obamacare and i have become fond of this term obamacare if you repeal it,Premise
those seniors right away are going to be paying 600 more in prescription care,Claim
theyre now going to have to be paying copays for basic checkups that can keep them healthier,Claim
the primary beneficiary of that repeal are insurance companies,Claim
that are estimated to gain billions of dollars back when they arent making seniors any healthier,Premise
i dont think thats the right approach when it comes to making sure that medicare is stronger over the long term,Claim
what i support is no change for current retirees and nearretirees to medicare,Claim
the president supports taking 716 billion out of that program,Claim
for people coming along that are young what i do to make sure that we can keep medicare in place for them is to allow them either to choose the current medicare program or a private plan,Claim
theyll have at least two plans that will be entirely at no cost to them,Claim
they dont have to pay additional money no additional 6000,Premise
thats not going to happen,Claim
theyll have at least two plans,Claim
people will be happy to get traditional medicare or theyll be able to get a private plan,Claim
if the government can be as efficient as the private sector and offer premiums that are as low as the private sector,Premise
i know my own view is id rather have a private plan,Claim
id rather be able to have an insurance company,Claim
id just assume not have the government telling me what kind of health care i get,Premise
if i dont like them i can get rid of them and find a different insurance company,Premise
we have to have the benefits high for those that are low income,Claim
for higher income people were going to have to lower some of the benefits,Claim
we have to make sure this program is there for the long term,Claim
thats the plan that ive put forward,Claim
the idea came not even from paul ryan or  or senator wyden whos the coauthor of the bill with  with paul ryan in the senate but also it came from bill  bill clintons chief of staff,Premise
this is an idea thats been around a long time,Premise
which is saying hey lets see if we cant get competition into the medicare world so that people can get the choice of different plans at lower cost better quality,Premise
i believe in competition,Premise
every study has shown that medicare has lower administrative costs than private insurance does,Premise
seniors are generally pretty happy with it,Claim
private insurers have to make a profit,Premise
nothing wrong with that,Premise
thats what they do,Premise
when you move to a voucher system you are putting seniors at the mercy of those insurance companies,Claim
youve got higher administrative costs plus profit on top of that,Claim
the money has to come from somewhere,Claim
if you are going to save any money through what governor romneys proposing,Premise
over time if traditional medicare has decayed or fallen apart then theyre stuck,Claim
this is the reason why aarp has said that your plan would weaken medicare substantially,Premise
thats why they were supportive of the approach that we took,Premise
we do have to lower the cost of health care not just in medicare and medicaid,Claim
the president said that the government can provide the service at lower cost and without a profit,Premise
if thats the case then it will always be the best product that people can purchase,Claim
my experience the private sector typically is able to provide a better product at a lower cost,Premise
regulation is essential,Claim
you have to have regulations so that you can have an economy work,Claim
you cant have a free market work if you dont have regulation,Claim
as a businessperson i had to have  i need to know the regulations,Premise
i needed them there,Premise
you couldnt have people opening up banks in their  in their garage and making loans,Premise
every free economy has good regulation,Premise
regulation can become excessive,Claim
in some places yes,Claim
other places no,Claim
it can become out of date,Premise
whats happened with some of the legislation thats been passed during the presidents term youve seen regulation become excessive and its hurt  its hurt the economy,Claim
let me give you an example,Premise
doddfrank was passed,Premise
it includes within it a number of provisions that i think has some unintended consequences that are harmful to the economy,Premise
one is it designates a number of banks as too big to fail and theyre effectively guaranteed by the federal government,Premise
this is the biggest kiss thats been given to  to new york banks ive ever seen,Premise
this is an enormous boon for them,Claim
thereve been 122 community and small banks have closed since dodd frank,Premise
i would repeal and replace it,Claim
were not going to get rid of all regulation,Claim
you have to have regulation,Premise
there are some parts of doddfrank that make all the sense in the world,Claim
you need transparency you need to have leverage limits for,Premise
the reason we have been in such a enormous economic crisis was prompted by reckless behavior across the board,Claim
it wasnt just on wall street,Claim
you had loan officers were  that were giving loans and mortgages that really shouldnt have been given because the folks didnt qualify,Premise
you had people who were borrowing money to buy a house that they couldnt afford,Premise
you had credit agencies that were stamping these as a1 great investments when they werent,Premise
you also had banks making money hand over fist churning out products that the bankers themselves didnt even understand in order to make big profits but knowing that it made the entire system vulnerable,Premise
we stepped in and had the toughest reforms on wall street since the 1930s,Premise
we said youve got  banks youve got to raise your capital requirements,Premise
you cant engage in some of this risky behavior that is putting main street at risk,Premise
weve going to make sure that youve got to have a living will so  so we can know how youre going to wind things down if you make a bad bet so we dont have other taxpayer bailouts,Premise
in the meantime by the way we also made sure that all the help that we provided those banks was paid back every single dime with interest,Premise
thats not what i believe,Claim
thats just not  thats just not the facts,Claim
i wouldnt designate five banks as too big to fail and give them a blank check,Claim
thats one of the unintended consequences of doddfrank,Premise
it wasnt thought through properly,Claim
we need to get rid of that provision,Claim
its killing regional and small banks,Premise
theyre getting hurt,Premise
governor romney has said he wants to repeal doddfrank,Claim
in the past governor romney has said he just want to repeal dodd frank roll it back,Claim
we have to have regulation on wall street,Premise
id have regulation,Claim
its hurt the housing market,Claim
its not that doddfrank always was wrong with too much regulation,Claim
doddfrank didnt anticipate putting in place the kinds of regulations you have to have,Premise
sometimes they didnt come out with a clear regulation,Claim
i will make sure we dont hurt the functioning of our  of our marketplace and our business,Claim
i want to bring back housing and get good jobs,Claim
let me mention another regulation in doddfrank,Premise
try and get a mortgage these days,Premise
so banks are reluctant to make loans mortgages,Premise
we dont know what a qualified mortgage is yet,Premise
its been two years,Premise
doddfrank correctly says we need to have qualified mortgages,Premise
if you give a mortgage thats not qualified there are big penalties except they didnt ever go on and define what a qualified mortgage was,Premise
its one of the reasons for the great financial calamity we had,Premise
thats exactly right,Premise
you say we were giving mortgages to people who werent qualified,Premise
i sure do,Claim
in part it comes again from my experience,Premise
i was in new hampshire,Premise
a woman came to me and she said look i cant afford insurance for myself or my son,Premise
i met a couple in appleton wisconsin and they said were thinking of dropping our insurance we cant afford it,Premise
and the number of small businesses ive gone to that are saying theyre dropping insurance because they cant afford it the cost of health care is just prohibitive,Premise
i dont want it,Claim
i want to put that money back in medicare for our seniors,Claim
weve got to deal with cost,Premise
when you look at obamacare the congressional budget office has said it will cost 2500 a year more than traditional insurance,Premise
its adding to cost,Premise
as a matter of fact when the president ran for office he said that by this year he would have brought down the cost of insurance for each family by 2500 a family,Premise
its gone up by that amount,Premise
its expensive,Claim
expensive things hurt families,Premise
it cuts 716 billion from medicare to pay for it,Premise
it puts in place an unelected board thats going to tell people ultimately what kind of treatments they can have,Claim
i dont like that idea,Premise
threequarters of them said it makes us less likely to hire people,Premise
there was a survey done of small businesses across the country said whats been the effect of obamacare on your hiring plans,Premise
it has killed jobs,Claim
i just dont know how the president could have come into office facing 23 million people out of work rising unemployment an economic crisis at the  at the kitchen table and spend his energy and passion for two years fighting for obamacare instead of fighting for jobs for the american people,Premise
the best course for health care is to do what we did in my state craft a plan at the state level that fits the needs of the state,Claim
lets focus on getting the costs down for people,Claim
rather than raising it with the 2500 additional premium,Premise
we did work on this alongside working on jobs,Claim
this is part of making sure that middleclass families are secure in this country,Premise
four years ago when i was running for office i was traveling around and having those same conversations that governor romney talks about,Premise
as a consequence theyre paying their premiums somebody gets really sick lo and behold they dont have enough money to pay the bills because the insurance companies say that theyve hit the limit,Premise
if they did have coverage insurance companies might impose an arbitrary limit,Premise
if they had a preexisting condition they might not be able to get coverage at all,Premise
it wasnt just that this was the biggest driver of our federal deficit our overall health care costs but it was families who were worried about going bankrupt if they got sick millions of families all across the country,Premise
it wasnt just that small businesses were seeing costs skyrocket and they couldnt get affordable coverage even if they wanted to provide it to their employees,Premise
it hasnt destroyed jobs,Claim
weve seen this model work really well in massachusetts,Premise
governor romney did a good thing working with democrats in the state to set up what is essentially the identical model and as a consequence people are covered there,Premise
we now have a system in which we have the opportunity to start bringing down costs as opposed to just leaving millions of people out in the cold,Claim
if youve got health insurance it doesnt mean a government takeover,Claim
you keep your own insurance,Premise
you keep your own doctor,Premise
it does say insurance companies cant jerk you around,Premise
they cant impose arbitrary lifetime limits,Premise
they have to let you keep your kid on their insurance  your insurance plan until youre 26 years old,Premise
it also says that youre going to have to get rebates if insurance companies are spending more on administrative costs and profits than they are on actual care,Premise
if you dont have health insurance were essentially setting up a group plan that allows you to benefit from group rates that are typically 18 percent lower than if youre out there trying to get insurance on the individual market,Claim
entirely on a partisan basis instead of bringing america together and having a discussion on this important topic you pushed through something that you and nancy pelosi and harry reid thought was the best answer and drove it through,Claim
i like the way we did it in massachusetts,Claim
in my state we had republicans and democrats come together and work together,Premise
what you did instead was to push through a plan without a single republican vote,Premise
when massachusetts did something quite extraordinary  elected a republican senator to stop obamacare you pushed it through anyway,Premise
what we did in a legislature 87 percent democrat we worked together,Premise
200 legislators in my legislature only two voted against the plan by the time we were finished,Premise
what were some differences we didnt raise taxes,Premise
youve raised them by 1 trillion under obamacare,Premise
we didnt cut medicare,Premise
of course we dont have medicare but we didnt cut medicare by 716 billion,Premise
we didnt put in place a board that can tell people ultimately what treatments theyre going to receive,Premise
we didnt also do something that i think a number of people across this country recognize which is put  put people in a position where theyre going to lose the insurance they had and they wanted,Premise
right now the cbo says up to 20 million people will lose their insurance as obamacare goes into effect next year,Premise
likewise a study by mckinsey and company of american businesses said 30 percent of them are anticipating dropping people from coverage,Premise
american people dont want medicare  dont want obamacare,Claim
for those reasons for the tax for medicare for this board and for people losing their insurance,Premise
its why republicans said do not do this and the republicans had  had the plan,Premise
they put a plan out,Premise
i think something this big this important has to be done on a bipartisan basis,Claim
they put out a plan a bipartisan plan,Premise
it was swept aside,Premise
we have to have a president who can reach across the aisle and fashion important legislation with the input from both parties,Claim
this was a bipartisan idea,Claim
governor romney said this has to be done on a bipartisan basis,Premise
it was a republican idea,Claim
governor romney at the beginning of this debate wrote and said what we did in massachusetts could be a model for the nation,Premise
i agree that the democratic legislators in massachusetts might have given some advice to republicans in congress about how to cooperate,Premise
the fact of the matter is we used the same advisers and they say its the same plan,Premise
when governor romney talks about this board for example unelected board that weve created what this is is a group of health care experts doctors et cetera to figure out how can we reduce the cost of care in the system overall,Premise
there are two ways of dealing with our health care crisis,Claim
one is to simply leave a whole bunch of people uninsured and let them fend for themselves,Claim
to let businesses figure out how long they can continue to pay premiums until finally they just give up and their workers are no longer getting insured,Claim
thats been the trend line,Premise
alternatively we can figure out how do we make the cost of care more effective,Claim
there are ways of doing it,Claim
at cleveland clinic one of the best health care systems in the world they actually provide great care cheaper than average,Premise
the reason they do is because they do some smart things,Premise
they say if a patients coming in lets get all the doctors together at once do one test instead of having the patient run around with 10 tests,Premise
lets make sure that were providing preventive care so were catching the onset of something like diabetes,Premise
lets pay providers on the basis of performance as opposed to on the basis of how many procedures theyve  theyve engaged in,Premise
what this board does is basically identifies best practices and says lets use the purchasing power of medicare and medicaid to help to institutionalize all these good things that we do,Claim
when obamacare is fully implemented were going to be in a position to show that costs are going down,Claim
over the last two years health care premiums have gone up  its true  but theyve gone up slower than any time in the last 50 years,Premise
were already beginning to see progress,Claim
in the meantime folks out there with insurance youre already getting a rebate,Premise
he hasnt described what exactly wed replace it with other than saying were going to leave it to the states,Claim
governor romney says we should replace it im just going to repeal it but  but we can replace it with something,Premise
theres no indication that that somehow is going to help somebody whos got a preexisting condition be able to finally buy insurance,Claim
the fact of the matter is that some of the prescriptions that hes offered like letting you buy insurance across state lines,Premise
its estimated that by repealing obamacare youre looking at 50 million people losing health insurance,Claim
at a time when its vitally important,Premise
preexisting conditions are covered under my plan,Claim
young people are able to stay on their family plan,Claim
thats already offered in the private marketplace,Premise
you dont have to have the government mandate that for that to occur,Premise
in my opinion the government is not effective in  in bringing down the cost of almost anything,Claim
he has as a model for doing that a board of people at the government an unelected board appointed board who are going to decide what kind of treatment you ought to have,Premise
lets come back to something the president and i agree on which is the key task we have in health care is to get the cost down so its more affordable for families,Premise
as a matter of fact free people and free enterprises trying to find ways to do things better are able to be more effective in bringing down the cost than the government will ever be,Premise
your example of the cleveland clinic is my case in point along with several others i could describe,Premise
this is the private market,Premise
these are enterprises competing with each other learning how to do better and better jobs,Premise
i used to consult to businesses  excuse me to hospitals and to health care providers,Premise
i was astonished at the creativity and innovation that exists in the american people,Premise
in order to bring the cost of health care down we dont need to have a board of 15 people telling us what kinds of treatments we should have,Claim
we instead need to put insurance plans providers hospitals doctors on target such that they have an incentive as you say performance pay for doing an excellent job for keeping costs down,Claim
thats happening,Claim
innermountain healthcare does it superbly well,Premise
mayo clinic is doing it superbly well cleveland clinic others,Premise
the right answer is not to have the federal government take over health care and start mandating to the providers across america telling a patient and a doctor what kind of treatment they can have,Claim
thats the wrong way to go,Claim
the private market and individual responsibility always work best,Claim
this board that were talking about cant make decisions about what treatments are given,Claim
thats explicitly prohibited in the law,Premise
that isnt what your plan does,Claim
governor romney indicated that under his plan he would be able to cover people with preexisting conditions,Premise
what your plan does is to duplicate whats already the law which says if you are out of health insurance for three months then you can end up getting continuous coverage and an insurance company cant deny you if youve  if its been under 90 days,Claim
thats already the law,Premise
that doesnt help the millions of people out there with preexisting conditions,Claim
theres a reason why governor romney set up the plan that he did in massachusetts,Premise
it wasnt a government takeover of health care,Claim
it was the largest expansion of private insurance,Claim
what it does say is that insurers youve got to take everybody,Premise
that also means that youve got more customers,Premise
when governor romney says that hell replace it with something but cant detail how it will be in fact replaced,Premise
he set up the system he did in massachusetts,Premise
there isnt a better way of dealing with the preexisting conditions problem,Claim
it just reminds me of you know he says that hes going to close deductions and loopholes for his tax plan,Premise
thats how its going to be paid for,Premise
we dont know the details,Premise
he says that hes going to replace doddfrank wall street reform but we dont know exactly which ones,Premise
he wont tell us,Premise
he now says hes going to replace obamacare and ensure that all the good things that are in it are going to be in there and you dont have to worry,Premise
the reason is is because when we reform wall street when we tackle the problem of preexisting conditions then you know these are tough problems and weve got to make choices,Claim
the choices weve made have been ones that ultimately are benefiting middleclass families all across the country,Claim
no,Claim
those are my principles,Claim
i want to bring down the tax burden on middleincome families,Claim
im going to work together with congress to say ok what  what are the various ways we could bring down deductions,Claim
what i do is the same way that tip oneill and ronald reagan worked together some years ago,Claim
which is my experience as a governor is if i come in and  and lay down a piece of legislation and say its my way or the highway i dont get a lot done,Premise
when ronald reagan ran for office he laid out the principles that he was going to foster,Premise
youve said the same thing youre going to simplify the tax code broaden the base,Premise
he said he was going to broaden the base,Premise
he said he was going to lower tax rates,Premise
there are alternatives to accomplish the objective i have which is to bring down rates broaden the base simplify the code and create incentives for growth,Claim
one could follow bowlessimpson as a model and take deduction by deduction and make differences that way,Premise
thats one way one could do it,Premise
then that number disappears for highincome people,Premise
anybody can have deductions up to that amount,Premise
make up a number 25000 50000,Premise
one way for instance would be to have a single number,Premise
i do have a plan that deals with people with preexisting conditions,Claim
thats part of my health care plan,Premise
what we did in massachusetts is a model for the nation state by state,Claim
i said that at that time,Premise
the federal government taking over health care for the entire nation and whisking aside the 10th amendment which gives states the rights for these kinds of things is not the course for america to have a stronger more vibrant economy,Claim
i definitely think there are differences,Claim
i also believe that government has the capacity the federal government has the capacity to help open up opportunity and create ladders of opportunity and to create frameworks where the american people can succeed,Claim
the first role of the federal government is to keep the american people safe,Claim
thats its most basic function,Claim
as commanderinchief that is something that ive worked on and thought about every single day that ive been in the oval office,Premise
the genius of america is the free enterprise system and freedom and the fact that people can go out there and start a business work on an idea make their own decisions,Premise
as abraham lincoln understood there are also some things we do better together,Premise
in the middle of the civil war abraham lincoln said lets help to finance the transcontinental railroad lets start the national academy of sciences lets start land grant colleges because we want to give these gateways of opportunity for all americans,Premise
if all americans are getting opportunity were all going to be better off,Premise
that doesnt restrict peoples freedom,Claim
that enhances it,Claim
what ive tried to do as president is to apply those same principles,Claim
when it comes to education what ive said is weve got to reform schools that are not working,Premise
we use something called race to the top,Premise
wasnt a topdown approach,Premise
what weve said is to states well give you more money if you initiate reforms,Premise
as a consequence you had 46 states around the country who have made a real difference,Premise
what ive also said is lets hire another 100000 math and science teachers to make sure we maintain our technological lead and our people are skilled and able to succeed,Premise
hardpressed states right now cant all do that,Premise
weve seen layoffs of hundreds of thousands of teachers over the last several years,Premise
governor romney doesnt think we need more teachers,Premise
i think that that is the kind of investment where the federal government can help,Claim
i do,Claim
it can make a difference,Claim
it cant do it all,Premise
well have a better trained workforce,Claim
that will create jobs,Claim
companies want to locate in places where weve got a skilled workforce,Premise
i reject the idea that i dont believe in great teachers or more teachers,Claim
the key to great schools great teachers,Premise
massachusetts our schools are ranked number one of all 50 states,Premise
i love great schools,Premise
every school district every state should make that decision on their own,Claim
the role of government is to promote and protect the principles of those documents,Claim
the role of government look behind us,Premise
the constitution and the declaration of independence,Premise
i do not believe in cutting our military,Claim
i believe in maintaining the strength of americas military,Claim
we have a responsibility to protect the lives and liberties of our people,Premise
that means a military second to none,Premise
i believe we must maintain our commitment to religious tolerance and freedom in this country,Claim
in that line that says we are endowed by our creator with our rights,Premise
that statement also says that we are endowed by our creator with the right to pursue happiness as we choose,Premise
i interpret that as one making sure that those people who are less fortunate and cant care for themselves are cared by  by one another,Premise
were a nation that believes that were all children of the same god and we care for those that have difficulties those that are elderly and have problems and challenges those that are disabled,Premise
we care for them,Premise
we look for discovery and innovation all these things desired out of the american heart to provide the pursuit of happiness for our citizens,Premise
we also believe in maintaining for individuals the right to pursue their dreams and not to have the government substitute itself for the rights of free individuals,Premise
its not working,Claim
what were seeing right now is in my view a  a trickledown government approach which has government thinking it can do a better job than free people pursuing their dreams,Premise
23 million people out of work,Premise
weve gone from 32 million on food stamps to 47 million on food stamps,Premise
1 out of 6 people in poverty,Premise
50 percent of college graduates this year cant find work,Premise
we know that the path were taking is not working,Claim
its time for a new path,Claim
the primary responsibility for education is  is of course at the state and local level,Claim
the federal government also can play a very important role,Claim
i agree with secretary arne duncan hes  some ideas hes put forward on race to the top not all of them but some of them i agree with and  and congratulate him for pursuing that,Premise
the federal government can get local and  and state schools to do a better job,Premise
i want the kids that are getting federal dollars from idea or title i  these are disabled kids or  or  or poor kids or  or lowerincome kids rather i want them to be able to go to the school of their choice,Claim
all federal funds instead of going to the  to the state or to the school district id have go if you will follow the child and let the parent and the child decide where to send their  their  their student,Claim
i think that it has a significant role to play,Claim
through our race to the top program weve worked with republican and democratic governors to initiate major reforms,Premise
theyre having an impact right now,Claim
this is where budgets matter,Claim
budgets reflect choices,Premise
when governor romney indicates that he wants to cut taxes and potentially benefit folks like me and him and to pay for it were having to initiate significant cuts in federal support for education that makes a difference,Premise
his running mate congressman ryan put forward a budget that reflects many of the principles that governor romneys talked about,Premise
it wasnt very detailed,Premise
this seems to be a trend,Premise
youd look at cutting the education budget by up to 20 percent,Claim
if you extrapolated how much money were talking about,Premise
when it comes to community colleges we are seeing great work done out there all over the country,Claim
we have the opportunity to train people for jobs that exist right now,Premise
one of the things i suspect governor romney and i probably agree on is getting businesses to work with community colleges so that theyre setting up their training programs where theyre partnering so that theyre designing training programs,Premise
people who are going through them know that theres a job waiting for them if they complete it,Premise
that makes a big difference,Claim
that requires some federal support,Claim
our priorities make a difference,Claim
when it comes to making college affordable whether its twoyear or fouryear one of the things that i did as president was we were sending 60 billion to banks and lenders as middlemen for the student loan program even though the loans were guaranteed,Premise
there was no risk for the banks or the lenders but they were taking billions out of the system,Premise
we said why not cut out the middleman,Premise
as a consequence what weve been able to do is to provide millions more students assistance lower or keep low interest rates on student loans,Premise
governor romney i genuinely believe cares about education but when he tells a student that you know you should borrow money from your parents to go to college you know that indicates the degree to which you know there may not be as much of a focus on the fact that folks like myself folks like michelle kids probably who attend university of denver just dont have that option,Premise
for us to be able to make sure that theyve got that opportunity and they can walk through that door that is vitally important not just to those kids,Claim
its how were going to grow this economy over the long term,Claim
im not going to cut education funding,Claim
i dont have any plan to cut education funding and  and grants that go to people going to college,Claim
im not planning on making changes there,Claim
the place you put your money just makes a pretty clear indication of where your heart is,Claim
90 billion that would have  that would have hired 2 million teachers,Premise
im all in favor of green energy,Premise
you put 90 billion into  into green jobs,Premise
90 billion,Premise
a number of them happened to be owned by people who were contributors to your campaigns,Premise
these businesses many of them have gone out of business i think about half of them of the ones have been invested in have gone out of business,Premise
the right course for americas government we were talking about the role of government is not to become the economic player,Claim
picking winners and losers,Claim
telling people what kind of health treatment they can receive,Claim
taking over the health care system that has existed in this country for a long long time and has produced the best health records in the world,Claim
the right answer for government is say how do we make the private sector become more efficient and more effective how do we get schools to be more competitive,Claim
lets grade them,Claim
i propose we grade our schools,Claim
i dont want to cut our commitment to education,Claim
so parents know which schools are succeeding and failing,Premise
so they can take their child to a  to a school that hes being more successful,Premise
i wanted to make it more effective and efficient,Claim
ive had that experience,Claim
i dont just talk about it,Premise
massachusetts schools are ranked number one in the nation,Premise
ive been there,Premise
i figured out from day one i had to get along and i had to work across the aisle to get anything done,Claim
i had the great experience  it didnt seem like it at the time  of being elected in a state where my legislature was 87 percent democrat,Premise
we drove our schools to be number one in the nation,Premise
we cut taxes 19 times,Premise
as president i will sit on day one  actually the day after i get elected  ill sit down with leaders  the democratic leaders as well as republican leaders and continue  as we did in my state,Claim
we met every monday for a couple hours talked about the issues and the challenges in the  in the  in our state in that case,Premise
we have to work on a collaborative basis,Claim
not because were going to compromise our principle but because theres common ground,Premise
the reason im in this race is there are people that are really hurting today in this country,Claim
this deficit could crush the future generations,Premise
whats happening in the middle east there are developments around the world that are of real concern,Premise
republicans and democrats both love america,Premise
we need to have leadership  leadership in washington that will actually bring people together and get the job done and could not care less if  if its a republican or a democrat,Claim
ive done it before,Premise
ill do it again,Claim
i think governor romneys going to have a busy first day,Claim
hes also going to repeal obamacare which will not be very popular among democrats as youre sitting down with them,Premise
i will take ideas from anybody democrat or republican as long as theyre advancing the cause of making middleclass families stronger and giving ladders of opportunity to the middle class,Claim
thats how we cut taxes for middle class families and small businesses,Premise
thats how we cut a trillion dollars of spending that wasnt advancing that cause,Premise
thats how we signed three trade deals into law that are helping us to double our exports and sell more american products around the world,Premise
thats how we repealed dont askdont tell,Premise
thats how we ended the war in iraq as i promised,Premise
thats how were going to wind down the war in afghanistan,Premise
thats how we went after al qaida and bin laden,Premise
weve seen progress even under republican control of the house of representatives,Claim
part of being principled part of being a leader is a being able to describe exactly what it is that you intend to do not just saying ill sit down but you have to have a plan,Claim
whats important is occasionally youve got to say no to  to  to folks both in your own party and in the other party,Claim
that was a fight that needed to be had,Claim
yes have we had some fights between me and the republicans when  when they fought back against us reining in the excesses of wall street absolutely,Premise
that was a fight that we needed to have,Claim
we were fighting about whether or not we were going to make sure that americans had more security with their health insurance and they said no,Premise
part of leadership and governing is both saying what it is that you are for but also being willing to say no to some things,Claim
governor romney when it comes to his own party during the course of this campaign has not displayed that willingness to say no to some of the more extreme parts of his party,Claim
my faith and confidence in the american future is undiminished,Claim
four years ago we were going through a major crisis,Premise
because of its people,Premise
because of the woman i met in north carolina who decided at 55 to go back to school because she wanted to inspire her daughter and now has a job from that new training that shes gotten,Premise
because a company in minnesota who was willing to give up salaries and perks for their executives to make sure that they didnt lay off workers during a recession,Premise
the auto workers that you meet in toledo or detroit take such pride in building the best cars in the world not just because of a paycheck but because it gives them that sense of pride that theyre helping to build america,Premise
everything that ive tried to do and everything that im now proposing for the next four years all those things are designed to make sure that the american people their genius their grit their determination is  is channeled and  and they have an opportunity to succeed,Claim
improving our education system,Premise
developing american energy,Premise
making sure that were closing loopholes for companies that are shipping jobs overseas,Premise
focusing on small businesses and companies that are creating jobs here in the united states,Premise
closing our deficit in a responsible balanced way that allows us to invest in our future,Premise
ive kept that promise,Claim
if youll vote for me then i promise ill fight just as hard in a second term,Claim
i also promised that id fight every single day on behalf of the american people the middle class and all those who were striving to get into the middle class,Premise
thats probably a promise that governor romney thinks ive kept,Premise
four years ago i said that im not a perfect man and i wouldnt be a perfect president,Premise
everybodys getting a fair shot,Premise
everybodys getting a fair share,Premise
everybodys doing a fair share,Premise
everybodys playing by the same rules,Premise
theres no question in my mind that if the president were to be reelected youll continue to see a middleclass squeeze with incomes going down and prices going up,Claim
you can look at the record,Premise
ill get incomes up again,Claim
youll see chronic unemployment,Claim
weve had 43 straight months with unemployment above 8 percent,Premise
if im president i will create  help create 12 million new jobs in this country with rising incomes,Claim
if the presidents reelected obamacare will be fully installed,Claim
many will lose it,Claim
youre going to see health premiums go up by some 2500 per family,Claim
if im elected we wont have obama,Claim
in my view thats going to mean a whole different way of life for people who counted on the insurance plan they had in the past,Claim
well put in place the kind of principles that i put in place in my own state,Claim
allow each state to craft their own programs to get people insured,Claim
well focus on getting the cost of health care down,Claim
if the president were to be reelected youre going to see a 716 billion cut to medicare,Claim
youll have 4 million people who will lose medicare advantage,Claim
youll have hospital and providers thatll no longer accept medicare patients,Claim
ill restore that 716 billion to medicare,Claim

the secretary of defense has said these would be even devastating,Premise
i will keep america strong,Claim
i will not cut our commitment to our military,Claim

its an election about the course of america,Claim
what kind of america do you want to have for yourself and for your children,Claim
there really are two very different paths that we began speaking about this evening,Premise
they lead in very different directions,Premise
this is an important election,Claim
i know this is bigger than an election about the two of us as individuals,Claim
its bigger than our respective parties,Claim
i think weve seen a deterioration of values,Claim
i think for a while as a nation we condoned those things we should have condemned,Claim
i think thats all wrong,Claim
it even seems to me that there was talk of legalizing or decriminalizing marijuana and other drugs,Claim
weve seen a deterioration in values,Claim
one of the things that i think we should do about it in terms of cause is to instill values into the young people in our schools,Claim
we got into this feeling that value free education was the thing,Claim
i dont believe that at all,Claim
i do believe there are fundamental rights and wrongs as far as use,Claim
weve got to do a lot better on education,Claim
be tougher on those who commit crimes,Claim
weve got to get after the users more,Claim
we have to change this whole culture,Claim
yes we can do better on interdiction,Claim
its bad,Claim
i saw a movie  crocodile dundee,Premise
i saw the cocaine scene treated with humor,Premise
as though this was a humorous little incident,Premise
everybody ought to be in this thing,Claim
i think were all in this together,Claim
my plea to the american people is values in the schools,Claim
i have put forward a manypoint drug program that includes what i would do as president of the united states,Claim
in terms of doing better on interdiction,Premise
in terms of better in the neighborhoods,Premise
we have got to instill values in these young people,Claim
it isnt a republican or a democrat or a liberal problem,Claim
entertainment industry people involved in the schools education,Premise
its important that our leaders demonstrate those values from the top,Claim
those of us who are elected to positions of political leadership have to reflect those values ourselves,Claim
weve been dealing with him,Claim
we are with a government thats been dealing with a drugrunning panamanian dictator,Claim
hes been dealing drugs to our kids,Claim
were providing that young woman with help,Claim
i remember being in a high school in my own state as we were organizing something we call the governors alliance against drugs,Premise
a young 16 year old girl coming up to me desperate addicted dependent saying governor i need help,Premise
governors like me and others have been trying to deal with the consequences,Claim
i want to be a president of the united states,Claim
who makes sure that we never again do business with a drugrunning panamanian dictator that we never again funnel aid to the contras through convicted drug dealers,Premise
values begin at the top in the white house,Claim
those are the values i want to bring to the presidency and to the white house beginning in january of 1989,Claim
i have outlined in detail the very important very strong program of enforcement as well as drug education prevention,Claim
its a little difficult for me to understand just how we can reach out to that youngster that i talked about and to young people like her all over the country,Claim
say to them we want to help you,Claim
i think were all in this together,Claim
my plea to the american people is values in the schools,Claim
when we bring our democratic neighbors and allies together here in this hemisphere and go to work together,Premise
ive outlined in great detail a program for being tough on enforcement at home and abroad doubling the number of drug enforcement agents having a hemispheric summit soon after the 20th of january,Claim

thats all im trying to do is put it in focus,Claim
i believe thats not what the american people want,Claim
when he said at the convention ideology doesnt matter just competence he was moving away from his own record from what his passion has been over the years,Claim
i am questioning his judgment on these matters,Claim
where hes coming from he has every right to do it,Claim
i am not,Claim
then all the liberal columnists join in,Premise
im not questioning his patriotism,Claim
he goes out and says the man is questioning my patriotism,Premise
governor thompson of illinois did,Claim
id have found a way to sign that bill,Claim
i think im more in touch with the mainstream of america,Claim
they raised the same thing with me on the pledge of allegiance,Claim
i come from a different point,Claim

we get to the issues that affect the vast majority of americans jobs schools health care housing the environment,Claim
i want to see the mckinney act fully funded,Claim
i believe that that would help in terms of shelter,Claim
i was talking about the enormous numbers of shelters and organizations that help,Claim
when i talked at our convention about a thousand points of light,Premise
this isnt government,Claim
my campaign chairman secretary jim bakers wife,Premise
the governors wife has been very active in the homeless,Premise
the government has a role,Claim
these are people that care,Claim
that are trying to give of themselves,Claim
it is to fully fund the mckinney act,Claim
weve got to attend to them,Claim
my short range answer is fully fund that mckinney act,Claim
i think maybe we could look back over our shoulders and wonder whether it was right to let all those mental patients out,Claim
maybe we need to do a better job in mental clinics to help them,Claim
there is a major problem there,Premise
a lot of them are mentally sick,Premise
were on the track on this one,Claim
that was a little overstated it,Premise
id say around 30 percent,Claim
i see the funding that is required,Claim

they gave it a great deal of conscience and a great deal of work,Premise
i see an involvement by a thousand points of light,Claim
i dont see this incidentally as a democrat or a republican or a liberal or conservative idea,Claim
i think that were on the right track,Claim
there are certain army bases that the act calls for that can be used in certain cases to shelter people when its rough,Claim
this is another fundamental difference that i have with the vice president,Claim
just as i do in the case of health care for 37 million members of working families in this country who dont have health insurance,Premise
youve cut back by 90 percent on our commitment to affordable housing for families of low and moderate income,Claim
the problem mr bush is,Premise
when you do that youve have homeless families,Claim
we didnt have two and a half million or three million homeless people living on streets and in doorways in this country ten years ago,Claim

housing for young families that they can look forward some day to buy,Claim
i think the housing community is ready,Claim
thats an essential commitment,Claim
weve got communities in this country increasingly where our own kids cant afford to live in the communities that they grew up in,Claim
this is one of the most important priorities that faces this country,Claim
weve got to have a president that can lead on this issue,Claim
that can work with the congress,Claim
im prepared to do so,Claim
while im all for the mckinney bill that by itself simply wont do,Claim
its going to take a president whos committed to housing,Premise
whos had experience in building and rehabilitating housing who understands that affordable housing for families of low and moderate income for young families first time home buyers,Premise
is an essential part of the american dream,Claim
i think so,Claim
i certainly hope not,Claim
we destined to become a nation of renters,Premise
i agree with him,Claim
mr bush talked about values,Premise
its all a question of what our priorities are,Claim
we need a president who will lead on this issue,Claim
who has had experience on this issue,Claim
its the kind of priority that will be at the top of our list beginning in january of 1989,Claim
the mckinney bill will do it just doesnt do,Claim
thats the kind of presidency i believe in,Claim
its so essential to our economic strength and to our future,Premise
do we spend money on that weapon system in the billions and trillions,Claim
is providing some decent and affordable housing for families of this country something that is at least as important and probably more so,Claim
thats a choice we have to make,Claim
mr bush wants to spend billions and trillions on star wars,Premise
it will require some funds,Claim
we ought to be prepared to provide those funds,Claim
that too will require some choices,Claim
we shouldnt expect that,Claim
ive talked to bankers and builders and developers the housing advocates community development agencies,Premise
they want leadership from washington,Claim
washington by itself cant do it all,Claim
this is a question of organizing the housing community,Claim
this isnt a question of a little charity for the homeless,Claim
thats the kind of leadership that i want to provide as president of the united states,Claim
we didnt sit around,Claim
back after world war ii when we had hundreds of thousands of gis who came back from the war,Premise
we went out and built housing,Claim
the government was very much involved,Premise
so was the housing industry,Premise
so was the banking industry,Premise
so were housing advocates,Premise
so were nonprofit agencies,Premise
so were governors and mayors and people all over this country who believe deeply in home ownership and affordable housing,Premise
i think the governor is blurring housing and the homeless,Claim
how does that grab you for increasing housing,Claim
ten days before i took the oath of office as president they were 21 and a half percent,Premise
we are serving a million more families now,Claim
housing is up,Claim
were not going to do it in that old democratic liberal way of trying to build more bricks and mortars,Claim
if we spend and spend and spend that is going to wrap up the housing marke,Claim
well go right back to the days of the misery index and malaise that president reagan and i have overcome,Claim
it is wrong,Claim
louis at some of that effort,Premise
go out and take a look at st,Premise
i favor home ownership,Claim
i want to see more vouchers,Claim
i want to see control of some of these projects,Claim
i want to keep the interest rates down,Claim
i dont think there is,Claim
there are two very different issues here,Claim
theyve got to be dealt with separately,Claim
is there a conflict between your opposition to the death penalty and your support for abortion on demand,Premise
even though in the minds of many people thats also killing,Premise
im opposed to the death penalty,Claim
i dont think most people do,Claim
i dont think its a good thing,Claim
i dont favor abortion,Claim
the question is who makes the decision,Claim
that makes that decision,Claim
i think it has to be the woman in the exercise of her own conscience and religious beliefs,Claim
the issue of abortion is a very difficult issue,Claim
i think that we all have to wrestle with,Claim
we have to come to terms with,Claim
i think everybody knows that,Claim
im also very tough on violent crime,Claim
thats one of the reasons why my state has cut crime by more than any other industrial state in america,Claim
its one of the reasons why we have the lowest murder rate of any industrial state in the country,Claim
its one of the reasons why we have a drug education and prevention program that is reaching out and helping youngsters all over our state,Claim
the kind of thing i want to do as president of the united states,Claim
i know its tough and honest people can disagree,Claim
i favor the death penalty,Claim
i do believe it would be inhibiting,Claim
the massachusetts furlough program was unique,Premise
the federal program doesnt do that,Claim
no other state programs do that,Claim
it was the only one in the nation that furloughed murderers who had not served enough time to be eligible for parole,Premise
i think they ought to pay with their life,Claim
when a narcotics wrapped up guy goes in and murders a police officer,Premise
i am not going to furlough men like willie horton,Claim
we have a fundamental difference on this one,Claim
they didnt want him to be furloughed again,Premise
the man who was furloughed the murderer,Premise
maryland would not extradite willie horton,Claim
i would meet with their the victims of his last escapade the rape and the brutalization of the family down there in maryland,Claim
i think most people know my position on the sanctity of life,Claim
i favor adoption,Claim
i do not favor abortion,Claim
i havent sorted out the penalties,Claim
i do know that i oppose abortion,Claim
i favor adoption,Claim
no im for the sanctity of life,Claim
once that illegality is established,Premise
we can come to grips with the penalty side,Claim
theres got to be some penalties to enforce the law,Claim
whatever they may be,Premise
we certainly do,Claim
as ive seen abortions sometimes used as a birth control device,Claim
this is one where you can have an honest difference of opinion,Claim
see the millions of these killings accumulate,Premise
its much clearer for me now,Claim
sometimes people feel a little uncomfortable talking about this,Premise
i have had a couple of exceptions that i support  rape incest and the life of the mother,Claim
its continuing to evolve,Claim
its evolving in favor of life,Claim
yes my position has evolved,Claim
everybody should make the extraordinary effort to take these kids that are unwanted and sometimes aborted,Claim
let them come to birth,Claim
then put them in a family where they will be loved,Claim
if we can get this law changed,Premise
i think what the vice president is saying is that hes prepared to brand a woman a criminal for making this decision,Claim
its as simple as that,Claim
i dont think its enough to come before the american people who are watching us tonight and say well i havent sorted it out,Claim
this is a very very difficult and fundamental decision that all of us have to make,Claim
hes prepared to brand a woman a criminal for making this choice,Claim
what he is saying if i understand him correctly,Premise
i think it has to be the woman in the exercise of her own conscience and religious beliefs that makes that decision,Claim
i think thats the right approach the right decision,Claim
i would hope by this time that mr bush had sorted out this issue and come to terms with it as i have,Claim
i respect his right to disagree with me,Claim
i think its important that we have a position that we take it,Claim
we state it to the american people,Claim
my fundamental philosophy is give local and state government as much control as possible,Claim
i do strongly support the wic program,Claim
i think it is good,Claim
i think part of the answer to this haunting of these children that are out there and suffering lies in extension of medicaid to challenge the states,Claim
maybe were going to have to enforce more on the states in terms of medicaid taking care of these,Claim
i think they understand my commitment to helping them in the neighborhoods,Claim
i think that part of it is the crime infested neighborhoods,Claim
thats why im a strong believer in trying to control crimes in the neighborhood,Claim
why i was so pleased to be endorsed by the policemen on the beat,Claim
the boston police department the other day,Premise
these are the combination of things i want,Claim
the fact that i dont think the federal government can endorse a 35 billion program does not mean i have less compassion than the person who endorses such a program,Claim
i favor that,Claim
ive already made a proposal,Claim
yes it will cost some money,Claim
im for head start and moving that up,Claim
its a combination of these things,Premise
the people that are out there trying to help these kids,Premise
the programs like cities and schools the work that barbara bush is doing so people can learn to read in this country and then go on and break this cycle of poverty,Premise
i must have been living through a different eight years then the ones the vice presidents been living through,Claim
this administration has cut and slashed and cut and slashed programs for children for nutrition for the kinds of things that can help these youngsters to live better lives,Premise
its cut federal aid to education,Claim
its cut pell grants and loans to close the door to college opportunity on youngsters all over this country,Claim
that too is a major difference between the vice president and me,Claim
thats the way you help people,Claim
we have a great many people hundreds of thousands of people living on public assistance in this country,Premise
the 50 governors of this nation have proposed to the congress that we help those families to get off of welfare,Premise
help those youngsters,Premise
help their mothers to become independent and selfsufficient,Premise
theyre still resisting,Claim
its taken months and months and months to get mr bush and the administration to support that legislation,Claim
i dont know what that means,Claim
being haunted a thousand points of light,Premise
i know what strong political leadership is,Claim
i know whats happened over the course of the past eight years,Claim
these programs have been cut and slashed and butchered,Claim
theyve hurt kids all over this country,Claim
you could improve the lives of families and youngsters and save money at the same time,Claim
welfare reform is one way to do it,Claim
that mother and her kids dont lose their health benefits when she goes to work,Claim
if we invest in job training in child care for those youngsters in some extended health benefits,Premise
we can help literally hundreds of thousands if not millions of families to get off of welfare to become independent and selfsufficient to be taxpaying citizens and to improve their lives the quality of lives their futures and the futures of those children,Claim
i think very unwisely,Claim
in my own state for example we now have that universal health care system which the vice president opposes,Claim
one of the greatest barriers to opportunity for a family and for those children is the threat that they mat lose their health insurance,Claim
i know the private sector is,Claim
these are the ways that you help families you help youngsters to live better lives and more decent lives,Claim
mr bush says well i dont think we ought to expect business to provide health insurance for their employees when responsible employers a majority of employers in this country do and are paying more for their insurance to reimburse hospitals for free care on account of people that are not insured that have to go to that hospital,Premise
it takes presidential leadership,Claim
it takes a commitment to being involved and the leading,Claim
thats the kind of presidency i want to lead,Claim
were ready to go to work at the state and local level all of us,Premise
what troubles me is that when i talk of the voluntary sector and a thousand points of light and a thousand different ways to help on these problems the man has just said he doesnt understand what im talking about,Claim
this is the problem i have with the big spending liberals,Claim
it is not down,Claim
the fact happens to be that education spending is up by the federal government,Claim
it is up,Claim
they think the only way to do it is for the federal government to do it all,Premise
i want to be the education president,Claim
i want to see us do better,Claim
the federal spending for education is up,Claim
the federal government spends seven percent of the total on education,Premise
the rest of the state governments and local governments and the thousand points of lightened im talking about private schools and private church schools and things of this natureare putting up 93 percent,Premise
we are not performing as we should,Claim
were putting more money per child into education,Premise
weve gotten away fro values and the fundamentals,Claim
i would like to urge the school superintendents and the others around the country to stand up now and keep us moving forward on a path towards real excellence,Claim
we can do it,Claim
itï€s not going to be dedicated by some federal bureaucracy in washington dc,Claim
of course not,Claim
of course thats a charge thats always made against any governor who runs for the presidency,Claim
i think it was one of the things that mr bush said about mr reagan back in 1980,Claim
its not the amount of time you spend in washington,Claim
its not the length of your resume,Claim
its your strength,Claim
its your values,Claim
its the quality of the people you pick,Claim
its your understanding of the forces of change that are sweeping the world,Claim
whether or not youre in a position to provide leadership to make those forces of change work for us and not against us,Claim
it didnt stop him from endorsing the sale of arms to the ayatollah,Claim
the vice president has a long resume,Premise
its strength,Claim
its values,Claim
i dont think its just experience that makes the difference,Claim
i think it take fresh leadership now and an understanding of those forces of change to provide the kind of strength that we need,Claim
i want to be the commander in chief of this country,Claim
im ready to provide that leadership,Claim
i dont believe that the fact youve got that long resume or had that experience is the real question,Claim

im not going to give away a couple of aces i that very tough card game,Claim
im simply not going to do that,Claim
under me when i lead this country the secretary of defense is going to have to make the choices between how we keep how we protect the survivability of our nuclear deployment on the midgetman missile or on the minuteman,Claim
my answer is do not make these unilateral cuts,Claim
everybody now realizes that peace through strength works,Premise
this is where i have a big difference,Claim

i didnt hear john exactly where he was going to cut and what he was going to do,Claim
mr bush was a lot more sympathetic to the freeze than he seems to be today,Claim
first let me say with respect to the freeze that back in the spring of 1982,Premise
weve piled up over a trillion dollars in debt and the next president of the united states is going to have to make some choices,Claim
i thought the administration was opposed to the midgetman,Claim
weve got to move ahead with the strategic arms negotiation process with the comprehensive test ban treaty and with negotiations leading to conventional force reduction in europe with deeper cuts on the soviet side and senator bentsen,Claim
i will pursue that policy,Claim
i dont think we need them to remain strong,Claim
i dont think we need these other systems,Claim

where i differ with my opponent is i am not going to make unilateral cuts in our strategic defend systems or support some freeze when they have superiority,Claim
we ought to say this is good,Claim
we should encourage that,Claim
im encouraged with what i hear when i talk to mr gorbachev and mr shevardnadze,Claim
can they pull it off,Premise
the soviet union seems to be walking down that same path,Claim
it was a very different george bush who was talking much more sympathetically about the freeze in the spring of 1982 than he is today,Claim
you were right then george when you said it was no time for partisan demagoguery,Claim
nobody is suggesting that we unilaterally disarm or somehow reduce our strength of course not,Claim
thats why we need a democratic administration in washington in 1989,Claim

no theres been no change of heart,Claim
it makes real sense,Claim
i said from the beginning that we ought to continue research into the strategic system at about the level that was added in 1983 thats about a billion dollars a year,Claim
i dont know of any reputable scientist who believed that this system at least as originally conceived could possibly work this notion of some kind of astrodome over ourselves that could protect us from enemy attack,Claim
as a matter of fact the system that the administration is now talking about is very different from the one that was originally proposed in 1983,Claim
im for continued research,Claim

youre cutting back on maintenance and equipment,Premise
were not making those choices,Claim
we need a strong credible effective nuclear deterrent,Claim
to spend billions and billions of dollars as mr bush apparently wants to although he himself has been all over the lot on this issue lately in my judgment makes no sense at all,Claim
we have 13000 strategic nuclear warheads right now on land on sea and in the air enough to blow up the soviet union forty times over,Claim
they have about 12000,Premise
weve got to move forward with those negotiations get the level of strategic weapons down,Claim
to continue to commit billions to this system makes no sense at all,Claim
i think mr bush has been reconsidering his position over the course of the past few weeks,Claim

we have made vast improvements in our antiterrorism,Claim

i think the experience of the twenties has shown what a free market could do to agriculture,Claim
if the agricultural economy collapses,Premise
the economy of the rest of the united states sooner or later will collapse,Claim
the farmers are the number one market for the automobile industry of the united states,Premise
the automobile industry is the number one market for steel,Premise
i think you would have a recession in the rest of the country,Claim
if the farmers economy continues to decline as sharply as it has in recent years,Premise
i think the case for the government intervention is a good one,Claim
there are no effective controls to bring supply and demand into better balance,Claim
the dropping of the support price in order to limit production does not work,Premise
we now have the highest uh  surpluses  nine billion dollars worth,Premise
weve had a uh  higher tax load from the treasury for the farmer in the last few years with the lowest farm income in many years,Premise
i think that this farm policy has failed,Claim
in my judgment the only policy that will work will be for effective supply and demand to be in balance,Claim
that can only be done through governmental action,Premise
i therefore suggest that in those basic commodities which are supported that the federal government after endorsement by the farmers in that commodity attempt to bring supply and demand into balance  attempt effective production controls,Claim
we wont have that five or six percent surplus which breaks the price fifteen or twenty per cent,Premise
i think mrbensons program has failed,Claim
i dont believe that its very much different from mr bensons,Claim
i dont think it provides effective governmental controls,Claim
i think the support prices are tied to the average market price of the last three years,Claim
which was mr bensons theory,Premise
i therefore do not believe that this is a sharp enough breach with the past to give us any hope of success for the future,Claim
i of course disagree with senator kennedy insofar as his suggestions as to what should be done uh  with re on the farm program,Claim
i think this is the wrong direction,Claim
i dont think this has worked in the past,Claim
i do not think it will work in the future,Claim
he has made the suggestion that what we need is to move in the direction of more government controls,Premise
a suggestion that would also mean raising prices,Premise
the consumers pay for products and im and imposing upon the farmers uh  controls on acreage even far more than they have today,Premise
it recognizes that the government has a responsibility to get the farmer out of the trouble he presently is in because the government got him into it,Premise
we cant let the farmer go by himself at the present time,Claim
the farmer produced these surpluses because the government asked him to through legislation during the war,Premise
its our responsibility to indemnify the farmer during that period that we get rid of the farmer uh  the surpluses,Premise
we should have a program such as i announced which will see that farm income holds up,Claim
i would propose holding that income up through one that would indemnify the farmer pay the farmer in kind uh  from the products which are in surplus,Claim
the question of executive leadership is a very important campaign issue,Claim
republican campaign slogans ay its experience that counts,Premise
youve had more governmental executive decisionmaking uh  experience than uh  your opponent,Claim
i think it would be improper for the president of the united states to disclose uh  the instances in which members of his official family had made recommendations,Claim
i have made them through the years to him,Premise
he is entitled to get what advice he wants from his cabinet and from his other advisers without disclosing that to anybody,Premise
i can only say that my experience is there for the people to consider,Claim
through the years i have sat in the national security council,Premise
i have been in the cabinet,Premise
i have met with the legislative leaders,Premise
i have met with the president when he made the great decisions with regard to lebanon quemoy and matsu other matters,Premise
the president has asked for my advice,Premise
i have given it,Premise
sometimes my advice has been taken,Premise
sometimes it has not,Premise
senator kennedys is there for the people to consider,Claim
mine has been in the executive branch,Premise
his has been in the legislative branch,Premise
i think both he and i are going to abide by whatever the people decide,Claim
the people now have the opportunity to evaluate his as against mine,Premise
the question is of experience,Premise
the question also is uh  what our judgment is of the future,Premise
what our goals are for the united states,Premise
what ability we have to implement those goals,Premise
theres no certain road to the presidency,Claim
i have been in the congress for fourteen years,Premise
i have voted in the last uh  eight years,Premise
the vice president was uh  presiding over the senate and meeting his other responsibilities,Premise
i have met met uh  decisions over eight hundred times on matters which affect not only the domestic security of the united states but as a member of the senate foreign relations committee,Premise
there are no guarantees that uh  if you take uh  one road or another that you will be a successful president,Claim
you call for expanding some of the welfare programs for schools for teacher salaries medical care and so forth,Premise
you also call for reducing the federal debt,Premise
you would go about paying the bill for all this,Claim
i did not advocate reducing the federal debt,Premise
i dont believe that youre going to be able to reduce the federal debt very much in nineteen sixtyone two or three,Claim
i think you have heavy obligations which affect our security,Claim
were going to have to meet,Premise
ive never suggested we should uh  be able to retire the debt substantially or even at all in nineteen sixtyone or two,Premise
in my judgment the hard money tight money policy fiscal policy of this administration has contributed to the slowdown in our economy,Claim
which helped bring the recession of fiftyfour,Premise
which made the recession of fiftyeight rather intense,Premise
which has slowed somewhat our economic activity in 1960,Premise
the kind of programs that ive talked about in my judgment are uh  fiscally sound,Claim
medical care for the aged i would put under social security,Premise
the vice president and i disagree on this,Claim
i support federal aid to education and federal aid for teachers salaries,Claim
the program which i advocated which failed by five votes in the united states senate would have put medical care for the aged in social security,Premise
would have been paid for through the social security system and the social security tax,Premise
the program  the javitsnixon or the nixon javits program  would have cost if fully used uh  six hundred million dollars by the government per year and six hundred million dollars by the state,Premise
i think thats a good investment,Claim
i think were going to have to do it,Claim
i think to heap the burden further on the property tax which is already strained in many of our communities will provide will make sh insure in my opinion that many of our children will not be adequately educated and many of our teachers not adequately compensated,Claim
there is no greater return to an economy or to a society than an educational system second to none,Premise
on the question of the development of natural resources i would pay as you go in the sense that they would be balanced,Premise
the power revenues would bring back sufficient money to finance the projects in the same way as the tennessee valley,Premise
i believe in the balanced budget,Claim
the only conditions under which i would unbalance the budget would be if there was a grave national emergency or a serious recession,Premise
mr nixon and mr rockefeller in their meeting said a five per cent economic growth would bring by 1962 ten billion dollars extra in tax revenues,Premise
i think that we can finance essential programs within a balanced budget,Claim
if business remains orderly,Premise
i think what mr novins was referring to was not one of senator kennedys speeches,Claim
the democratic platform which did mention cutting the national debt,Claim
i think too that it should be pointed out that of course it is not possible either to cut the national debt or to reduce taxes,Claim
it will be necessary to raise taxes,Premise
as senator kennedy points out that as far as his one proposal is concerned  the one for medical care for the aged  that that would be financed out of social security,Premise
that however is raising taxes for those who pay social security,Claim
he points out that he would make payasyougo be the basis for our natural resources development,Premise
our natural resources development  which i also support,Claim
it doesnt mean that you  the government doesnt have to put out the money this year,Claim
whenever you uh  uh  in  in  uh  appropriates money for one of these projects you have to pay now and appropriate the money and the eh while they eventually do pay out,Premise
he has to raise taxes,Claim
he has to unbalance the budget,Claim
you have inflation,Premise
as far as aid for school construction is concerned i favor that,Claim
i believe thats the best way to aid our schools,Claim
without running any risk whatever of the federal government telling our teachers what to teach,Premise
i think you asked for a crash program to raise education standards,Claim
you said  it was back in 1957  that salaries paid to school teachers were nothing short of a national disgrace,Premise
higher salaries for teachers you added were important,Premise
if the situation wasnt corrected it could lead to a national disaster,Premise
you refused to vote in the senate in order to break a tie vote,Claim
that single vote if it had been yes would have granted salary increases to teachers,Premise
i think that the reason that i voted against having the federal government uh  pay teachers salaries was probably the very reason that concerned senator kennedy,Claim
in his kickoff press conference he said that he favored aid for school construction,Premise
at that time did not feel that there should be aid for teachers salaries,Premise
we want higher teachers salaries,Claim
we also want our education to be free of federal control,Claim
we need higher teachers salaries,Claim
inevitably in my opinion it will acquire the power to set standards and to tell the teachers what to teach,Claim
when the federal government gets the power to pay teachers,Premise
i think this would be bad for the country,Claim
i think it would be bad for the teaching profession,Claim
i favor higher salaries for teachers,Claim
the way that you get higher salaries for teachers is to support school construction,Premise
all of the local school districts in the various states then have money which is freed to raise the standards for teachers salaries,Premise
your local communities and your states are not going to meet the responsibility as much as they should,Claim
once you put the responsibility on the federal government for paying a portion of teachers salaries,Premise
i believe in other words that we have seen the local communities and the state assuming more of that responsibility,Claim
teachers salaries very fortunately have gone up fifty percent in the last eight years as against only a thirtyfour percent rise for other salaries,Premise
i do not believe that the way to get more salaries for teachers is to have the federal government get in with a massive program,Claim
my objection here is the potential cost in controls and eventual freedom for the american people by giving the federal government power over education,Premise
my objection here is not the cost in dollars,Premise
i do not believe the federal government should pay directly teachers salaries,Claim
that was not the issue before the senate in february,Premise
the issue before the senate was that the money would be given to the state,Premise
the state then could determine whether the money would be spent for school construction or teacher salaries,Premise
on that question the vice president and i disagreed,Claim
i voted in favor of that proposal and supported it strongly,Premise
i think that that provided assistance to our teachers for their salaries without any chance of federal control,Claim
it is on that vote that th mr nixon and i disagreed,Premise
his tie vote uh  defeated his breaking the tie defeated the proposal,Premise
i dont want the federal government paying teachers salaries directly,Claim
in my opinion you protect the local authority over the school board and the school committee,Claim
if the money will go to the states,Premise
the states can then determine whether it shall go for school construction or for teachers salaries,Premise
therefore i think that was a sound proposal,Claim
that is why i supported it,Premise
i regret that it did not pass,Premise
that is wholly wrong wholly in error,Claim
that is not my view and i think it ought to be stated very clearly on the record,Claim
t is a fact that in the last eight years the democratic congress has reduced the appropri the requests for the appropriations by over ten billion dollars,Premise
the democratic platform would cost a good deal of money,Premise
i am in favor of unbalancing the budget,Premise
my view is that you can do these programs within a balanced budget,Claim
if our economy is moving ahead,Premise
if you are elected president,Premise
youll try and push through congress bills on medical aid to the aged a comprehensive minimum hourly wage bill federal aid to education,Claim
we did pass in the senate a bill uh  to provide a dollar twentyfive cent minimum wage,Premise
we passed a federal aid to education bill in the senate,Premise
the house failed by eleven votes,Premise
twothirds of the republicans in the house voted against a dollar twentyfive cent minimum wage,Premise
a majority of the democrats sustained it  nearly twothirds of them voted for the dollar twentyfive,Premise
it failed,Claim
the house did not pass it,Premise
its extremely difficult with the great power that the president does to pass any bill when the president is opposed to it,Claim
all the president needs to sustain his veto of any bill is onethird plus one in either the house or the senate,Premise
it failed to came to the floor of the house of representatives,Claim
it was killed in the rules committee,Premise
it is a fact in the august session that the four members of the rules committee who were republicans joining with two democrats voted against sending the aid to education bill to the floor of the house,Premise
four democrats voted for it,Premise
every republican on the rules committee voted against sending that bill to be considered by the members of the house of representatives,Premise
we wanted to tie it to social security,Claim
we offered an amendment to do so,Premise
fortyfour democrats voted for it,Premise
one republican voted for it,Premise
we were informed at the time it came to a vote that if it was adopted the president of the united states would veto it,Premise
in my judgment a vigorous democratic president supported by a democratic majority in the house and senate can win the support for these programs,Claim
in my judgment you will continue what happened in the august session which is a clash of parties and inaction,Claim
if you send a republican president and a democratic majority and the threat of a veto hangs over the congress,Premise
well obviously my views are a little different,Claim
there are eight democrats on that committee and four republicans,Premise
it is very difficult to blame the four republicans for the eight democrats not getting a something through that particular committee,Claim
to blame the president in his veto power for the inability of the senator and his colleagues to get action in this special session uh  misses the mark,Claim
he has to have the people upo behind him not just a third of the congress,Premise
why didnt they pass them and send to the president and get a veto and have an issue,Claim
if the majority of the members of the congress felt that these particular proposals were good issues,Premise
the reason why these particular bills in these various fields that have been mentioned were not passed was not because the president was against them,Claim
it was because the people were against them,Claim
it was because they were too extreme,Claim
they could get through the next congress,Claim
they are not extreme,Premise
they will accomplish the end uh  without too great cost in dollars or in freedom,Premise
we of course expect to pick up some seats in both in the house and the senate,Claim
we would hope to control the house to get a majority in the house uh  in this election,Premise
we cannot of course control the senate,Premise
a president will be able to lead  a president will be able to get his program through  to the effect that he has the support of the country the support of the people,Claim
it isnt really that,Claim
whenever a majority of the people are for a program the house and the senate responds to it,Premise
i believe that you will find that the president if it were a republican as it would be in my case would be able to get his program through that congress,Claim
if the country will have voted for the candidate for the presidency and for the proposals that he has made,Premise
you must always remember that a president cant stop anything unless he has the people behind him,Claim
the reason president eisenhowers vetoes have been sustained  the reason the congress does not send up bills to him which they think will be vetoed  is because the people and the congress the majority of them know the country is behind the president,Premise
one was a bill for a dollar twentyfive cents an hour for anyone who works in a store or company that has a million dollars a year business,Premise
i dont think thats extreme at all,Claim
yet nearly twothirds to threefourths of the republicans in the house of representatives voted against that proposal,Premise
because of the defeat of teacher salaries it was not a bill that uh  met in my opinion the need,Claim
it was a bill that was less than you recommended mr nixon this morning in your proposal,Premise
it was not an extreme bill,Claim
yet we could not get one republican to join,Premise
i think four of the eight democrats voted to send it to the floor of the house  not one republican  and they joined with those democrats who were opposed to it,Claim
i dont say the democrats are united in their support of the program,Claim
i do say a majority are,Claim
i say a majority of the republicans are opposed to it,Claim
i think it shows the difference between the two parties,Claim
it does not put a deficit on the treasury,Claim
the proposal advanced by you and by mr javits would have cost six hundred millions of dollars,Premise
mr rockefeller rejected it in new york said he didnt agree with the financing at all said it ought to be on social security,Premise
one party is ready to move in these programs,Claim
the other party gives them lip service,Claim
well i think theyre serious,Claim
i think its a matter that we should continue to uh  give uh  great care and attention to,Claim
we should support uh  the laws which the united states has passed in order to protect us from uh  those who would destroy us from within,Claim
we should sustain uh  the department of justice in its efforts and the fbi,Claim
we should be continually alert,Claim
i think that we can meet any internal threat,Claim
if the united states is maintaining a strong society here in the united states,Premise
the major threat is external and will continue,Claim
i agree with senator kennedys appraisal generally in this respect,Claim
the question of communism within the united states has been one that has worried us in the past,Premise
it is one that will continue to be a problem for years to come,Premise
we have to remember that the cold war that mr khrushchev is waging and his colleagues are waging is waged all over the world and its waged right here in the united states,Premise
thats why we have to continue to be alert,Claim
it is also essential in being alert that we be fair,Claim
fair because by being fair we uphold the very freedoms that the communists would destroy,Premise
we uphold the standards of conduct which they would never follow,Premise
i think that uh  we must look to the future having in mind the fact that we fight communism at home not only by our laws to deal with communists uh  the few who do become communists and the few who do become tra fellow travelers but we also fight communism at home by moving against those various injustices which exist in our society which the communists feed upon,Claim
i do believe that he uh  would agree that i am just as sincere in believing that my proposals for federal aid to education my proposals for health care are just as sincerely held as his,Claim
that is the growth that we are looking for,Claim
it is the growth that this administration has supported and that its policies have stimulated,Claim
that is growth,Claim
this administration has encouraged individual enterprise,Premise
it has resulted in the greatest expansion of the private sector of the economy that has ever been witnessed in an eightyear period,Premise
i must say that the reason that the schools have been constructed is because the local school districts were willing to increase the property taxes to a tremendously high figure  in my opinion almost to the point of diminishing returns in order to sustain these schools,Claim
i think we have a rich uh  country,Claim
i think we have a powerful country,Claim
i think what we have to do however is have the president and the leadership set before our country exactly what we must do in the next decade,Claim
if were going to maintain our security in education in economic growth in development of natural resources,Premise
i think thats the big assignment the big task the big function of the federal government,Claim
i want to compare what were doing with what our adversaries are doing so that by the year 1970 the united states is ahead in education in health in building in homes in economic strength,Claim
i think it is well to put in perspective where we really do stand with regard to the soviet union in this whole matter of growth,Claim
the soviet union has been moving faster than we have,Claim
they start from a much lower base,Premise
today that their total gross national product is only fortyfour per cent of our total gross national product,Premise
thats the same percentage that it was twenty years ago,Premise
we find that the united states is even further ahead than it was twenty years ago,Claim
these are determined men,Premise
they are fanatical men,Premise
we have to get the very most of uh  out uh  out of our economy,Premise
i agree with senator kennedy completely on that score,Claim
where we disagree is in the means that we would use to get the most out of our economy,Claim
senator kennedy too often would rely too much on the federal government on what it would do to solve our problems to stimulate growth,Premise
i believe that when we examine the democratic platform when we examine the proposals that he has discussed tonight when we compare them with the proposals that i have made that these proposals that he makes would not result in greater growth for this country than would be the case if we followed the programs that i have advocated,Claim
our health program  the one that senator javits and other republican senators as well as i supported  is one that provides for all people over sixtyfive who want health insurance the opportunity to have it if they want it,Premise
it provides a choice of having either government insurance or private insurance,Premise
it compels nobody to have insurance who does not want it,Premise
his program under social security would require everybody who had social security to take government health insurance whether he wanted it or not,Premise
it would not cover several million people who are not covered by social security at all,Premise
i think that our program does a better job than his,Claim
this downgrading of how much things cost i think many of our people will understand better when they look at what happened when  during the truman administration when the government was spending more than it took in  we found savings over a lifetime eaten up by inflation,Claim
we found the people who could least afford it  people on retired incomes uh  people on fixed incomes  we found them unable to meet their bills at the end of the month,Premise
it is essential that a man whos president of this country certainly stand for every program that will mean for growth,Premise
i stand for programs that will mean growth and progress,Claim
it is also essential that he not allow a dollar spent that could be better spent by the people themselves,Premise
i want to make sure that it stays in that relationship,Claim
i must say that fortyfour percent and that soviet country is causing us a good deal of trouble tonight,Claim
i dont want to see the day when its sixty percent of ours and seventy and seventyfive and eighty and ninety percent of ours with all the force and power that it could bring to bear in order to cause our destruction,Claim
our program was an amendment to the kerr bill,Premise
the kerr bill provided assistance to all those who were not on social security,Premise
i think its a very clear contrast,Claim
in 1935 when the social security act was written ninetyfour out of ninetyfive republicans voted against it,Premise
mr landon ran in 1936 to repeal it,Premise
in august of 1960 when we tried to get it again but this time for medical care we received the support of one republican in the senate on this occasion,Premise
i think the question before the american people is as they look at this country and as they look at the world around them the goals are the same for all americans,Claim
the means are at question,Claim
the means are at issue,Claim
i agree i think you should vote for mr nixon,Claim
if you feel that everything that is being done now is satisfactory,Premise
the relative power and prestige and strength of the united states is increasing in relation to that of the communists,Premise
weve b gaining more security,Premise
we are achieving everything as a nation that we should achieve,Premise
we are achieving a better life for our citizens and greater strength,Premise
if you feel that we have to move again in the sixties,Premise
the function of the president is to set before the people the unfinished business of our society as franklin roosevelt did in the thirties,Premise
the agenda for our people  what we must do as a society to meet our needs in this country and protect our security and help the cause of freedom,Claim
can freedom in the next generation conquer or are the communists going to be successful thats the great issue,Claim
i think freedom will conquer,Claim
i think that uh  the tide could begin to run against us,Claim
if we fail to move ahead,Premise
if we fail to develop sufficient military and economic and social strength here in this country,Premise
i dont want historians ten years from now to say these were the years when the tide ran out for the united states,Claim
i want them to say these were the years when the tide came in these were the years when the united states started to move again,Claim
i think were ready to move,Claim
it is to that great task if were successful that we will address ourselves,Claim
every president faces at some point an unexpected threat to our national security from abroad,Claim
tonights debate as both of you know comes on the 50th anniversary of the night that president kennedy told the world that the soviet union had installed nuclear missiles in cuba perhaps the closest weve ever come to nuclear war,Premise
the controversy over what happened there continues,Claim
questions remain,Premise
four americans are dead including an american ambassador,Premise
weve seen in nation after nation a number of disturbing events,Claim
we see in syria 30000 civilians having been killed by the military there,Premise
we see in  in libya an attack apparently by i think we know now by terrorists of some kind against  against our people there four people dead,Premise
mali has been taken over the northern part of mali by alqaeda type individuals,Premise
we have in  in egypt a muslim brotherhood president,Premise
what were seeing is a pretty dramatic reversal in the kind of hopes we had for that region,Claim
with the arab spring came a great deal of hope that there would be a change towards more moderation,Premise
opportunity for greater participation on the part of women in public life and in economic life in the middle east,Premise
this is obviously an area of great concern to the entire world and to america in particular which is to see a  a complete change in the  the structure and the  the environment in the middle east,Premise
the greatest threat of all is iran,Claim
four years closer to a nuclear weapon,Premise
we cant kill our way out of this mess,Premise
were going to have to put in place a very comprehensive and robust strategy to help the  the world of islam and other parts of the world reject this radical violent extremism,Claim
its certainly not on the run,Claim
we have to do as the president has done,Claim
i congratulate him on  on taking out osama bin laden and going after the leadership in alqaeda,Premise
its certainly not hiding,Claim
we must have a comprehensive strategy to help reject this kind of extremism,Claim
it presents an enormous threat to our friends to the world to america long term,Premise
this is a group that is now involved in 10 or 12 countries,Premise
thats what weve done over the last four years,Claim
my first job as commander in chief bob is to keep the american people safe,Premise
we ended the war in iraq,Premise
refocused our attention on those who actually killed us on 911,Premise
as a consequence al qaedas core leadership has been decimated,Premise
in addition were now able to transition out of afghanistan in a responsible way making sure that afghans take responsibility for their own security,Premise
that allows us also to rebuild alliances and make friends around the world to combat future threats,Premise
thats exactly what were going to do,Claim
with respect to libya as i indicated in the last debate when we received that phone call i immediately made sure that number one that we did everything we could to secure those americans who were still in harms way,Premise
number two that we would investigate exactly what happened,Premise
number three most importantly that we would go after those who killed americans and we would bring them to justice,Premise
i think its important to step back and think about what happened in libya,Claim
we stand with them,Claim
got rid of a despot who had killed americans and as a consequence despite this tragedy you had tens of thousands of libyans after the events in benghazi marching and saying america is our friend,Premise
keep in mind that i and americans took leadership in organizing an international coalition that made sure that we were able to without putting troops on the ground at the cost of less than what we spent in two weeks in iraq liberate a country that had been under the yoke of dictatorship for 40 years,Premise
my strategy is pretty straightforward,Claim
which is to go after the bad guys to make sure we do our very best to interrupt them to  to kill them to take them out of the picture,Premise
your strategy previously has been one that has been all over the map and is not designed to keep americans safe or to build on the opportunities that exist in the middle east,Claim
that represents the opportunity we have to take advantage of,Claim
my strategy is broader than that,Claim
the key that were going to have to pursue is a  is a pathway to get the muslim world to be able to reject extremism on its own,Claim
we dont want another iraq,Premise
we dont want another afghanistan,Premise
thats not the right course for us,Premise
the right course for us is to make sure that we go after the  the people who are leaders of these various antiamerican groups and these  these jihadists but also help the muslim world,Claim
we should key our foreign aid our direct foreign investment and that of our friends,Claim
we should coordinate it to make sure that we  we push back and give them more economic development,Claim
the answer they came up with was this  one more economic development,Premise
a group of arab scholars came together organized by the un to look at how we can help the  the world reject these  these terrorists,Premise
number two better education,Premise
number three gender equality,Premise
number four the rule of law,Premise
we have to help these nations create civil societies,Claim
this is a region in tumult,Claim
with syria having assad continuing to  to kill to murder his own people,Premise
with mali now having north mali taken over by al qaida,Premise
iran on the path to a nuclear weapon weve got real inaudible,Premise
we want  we want to make sure that were seeing progress throughout the middle east,Claim
libyas 6 million population egypt 80 million population,Premise
next door of course we have egypt,Premise
its wonderful that libya seems to be making some progress despite this terrible tragedy,Premise
theyre throughout many nations in the middle east,Premise
whats been happening over the last couple of years is as weve watched this tumult in the middle east this rising tide of chaos occur you see al qaida rushing in you see other jihadist groups rushing in,Premise
im glad that you recognize that al qaida is a threat,Claim
a few months ago when you were asked whats the biggest geopolitical threat facing america you said russia not al qaida,Claim
you said russia in the 1980s theyre now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because you know the cold wars been over for 20 years,Premise
when it comes to our foreign policy you seem to want to import the foreign policies of the 1980s just like the social policies of the 1950s and the economic policies of the 1920s,Claim
but just a few weeks ago you said you think we should have more troops in iraq right now,Premise
you say that youre not interested in duplicating what happened in iraq,Premise
every time youve offered an opinion youve been wrong,Claim
you said we should have gone into iraq despite that fact that there were no weapons of mass destruction,Premise
you indicated that we shouldnt be passing nuclear treaties with russia despite the fact that 71 senators democrats and republicans voted for it,Premise
you said that we should still have troops in iraq to this day,Premise
you said that first we should not have a timeline in afghanistan,Premise
then you said we should,Premise
now you say maybe or it depends,Premise
not only were you wrong but you were also confusing in sending mixed messages both to our troops and our allies,Claim
what we need to do with respect to the middle east is strong steady leadership,Claim
not wrong and reckless leadership that is all over the map,Claim
thats the kind of opinions that youve offered throughout this campaign,Claim
it is not a recipe for american strength or keeping america safe over the long haul,Claim
they dont happen to be accurate,Claim
i dont concur with what the president said about my own record and the things that ive said,Claim
russia i indicated is a geopolitical foe,Claim
its a geopolitical foe and i said in the same  in the same paragraph i said and iran is the greatest national security threat we face,Claim
russia does continue to battle us in the un time and time again,Premise
i have clear eyes on this,Premise
im not going to wear rosecolored glasses when it comes to russia or mr putin,Claim
im certainly not going to say to him ill give you more flexibility after the election,Claim
after the election hell get more backbone,Claim
what i would not have had done was left 10000 troops in iraq that would tie us down,Claim
that certainly would not help us in the middle east,Premise

it is absolutely true that we cannot just meet these challenges militarily,Claim
youve got to be clear both to our allies and our enemies about where you stand and what you mean,Premise
that is not a recipe for making sure that we are taking advantage of the opportunities and meeting the challenges of the middle east,Claim

that will help us maintain the kind of american leadership that we need,Premise
i am confident that assads days are numbered,Claim
what we cant do is to simply suggest that as governor romney at times has suggested that giving heavy weapons for example to the syrian opposition is a simple proposition that would lead us to be safer over the long term,Claim
we have to do so making absolutely certain that we know who we are helping,Claim
for us to get more entangled militarily in syria is a serious step,Premise
that were not putting arms in the hands of folks who eventually could turn them against us or allies in the region,Claim
we are going to do everything we can to make sure that we are helping the opposition,Claim
what were seeing taking place in syria is heartbreaking,Premise
everything were doing were doing in consultation with our partners in the region including israel which obviously has a huge interest in seeing what happens in syria,Premise
coordinating with turkey and other countries in the region that have a great interest in this,Premise
ultimately syrians are going to have to determine their own future,Claim

30000 people being killed by their government is a humanitarian disaster,Premise
seeing syria remove assad is a very high priority for us,Claim
seeing a  a replacement government being responsible people is critical for us,Claim
the right course for us is working through our partners and with our own resources to identify responsible parties within syria organize them bring them together in a  in a form of  if not government a form of  of  of council that can take the lead in syria,Claim
we dont want to get drawn into a military conflict,Premise

i believe that assad must go,Claim
i believe he will go,Claim
we want to make sure that we have the relationships of friendship with the people that take his place,Claim
steps that in the years to come we see syria as a  as a friend and syria as a responsible party in the middle east,Premise
we should be playing the leadership role there not on the ground with military,Claim
then it went to the russians and said lets see if you can do something,Premise
that didnt work,Premise
kofi annan came in and said were going to try to have a ceasefire,Premise
what im afraid of is weve watched over the past year or so first the president saying well well let the un deal with it,Premise

going back to libya  because this is an example of how we make choices,Premise
we have to take the same kind of steady thoughtful leadership when it comes to syria,Claim
we did so in a careful thoughtful way making certain that we knew who we were dealing with that those forces of moderation on the ground were ones that we could work with,Premise
thats part of the reason why the libyans stand with us,Premise
we were going to make sure that we finished the job,Premise
moammar gadhafi had more american blood on his hands than any individual other than osama bin laden,Premise
imagine if we had pulled out at that point,Premise
when it came time to making sure that gadhafi did not stay in power that he was captured governor your suggestion was that this was mission creep that this was mission muddle,Premise
to the governors credit you supported us going into libya and the coalition that we organized,Premise
we also had to make sure that moammar gadhafi didnt stay there,Premise
when we went in to libya and we were able to immediately stop the massacre there because of the unique circumstances and the coalition that we had helped to organize,Premise
thats exactly what were doing,Claim
i dont want to have our military involved in syria,Claim
i dont anticipate that in the future,Claim
i dont think there is a necessity to put our military in syria at this stage,Claim
as i indicated our objectives are to replace assad and to have in place a new government which is friendly to us a responsible government if possible,Premise
i want to make sure they get armed and they have the arms necessary to defend themselves,Claim
also to remove  to remove assad,Claim
i do not want to see a military involvement on the part of our  of our troops,Claim
this isnt going to be necessary,Claim
we have with our partners in the region we have sufficient resources to support those groups,Premise
this should have been a time for american leadership,Claim
this has been going on for a year,Premise
we should have taken a leading role not militarily but a leading role organizationally governmentally to bring together the parties,Claim
to find responsible parties,Claim
we need to make sure they have the arms they need to carry out the very important role which is getting rid of assad,Claim
america can help that happen,Premise
that needs to happen,Claim
they havent formed a unity group a council of some kind,Premise
they havent come together,Premise
as you hear from intelligence sources even today the  the insurgents are highly disparate,Premise
were doing exactly what we should be doing to try to promote a moderate syrian leadership and a  an effective transition so that we get assad out,Claim
what you just heard governor romney said is he doesnt have different ideas,Premise
thats the kind of leadership well continue to show,Claim
thats the kind of leadership weve shown,Premise
no i dont,Claim
america has to stand with democracy,Premise
the notion that we would have tanks run over those young people who were in tahrir square that is not the kind of american leadership that john f kennedy talked about 50 years ago,Premise

these countries cant develop if young women are not given the kind of education that they need,Premise
that is a red line for us,Claim
they have to abide by their treaty with israel,Claim

what is also important for us to understand is is that for america to be successful in this region theres some things that were going to have to do here at home as well,Claim
one of the things that weve been doing is is for example organizing entrepreneurship conferences with these egyptians to give them a sense of how they can start rebuilding their economy in a way thats noncorrupt thats transparent,Premise
you know one of the challenges over the last decade is weve done experiments in nation building in places like iraq and afghanistan and weve neglected for example developing our own economy our own energy sectors our own education system,Premise

i wish wed have had a better vision of the future,Claim
i wish that looking back at the beginning of the presidents term and even further back than that that wed have recognized that there was a growing energy and passion for freedom in that part of the world,Premise
that we would have worked more aggressively with our friend and with other friends in the region to have them make the transition towards a more representative form of government such that it didnt explode in the way that it did,Premise
once it exploded i felt the same as the president did which is these freedom voices and the streets of egypt where the people who were speaking of our principles and the president mubarak had done things which were unimaginable and the idea of him crushing his people was not something that we could possibly support,Premise

governor romneys plan doesnt do it,Claim
weve got to do it in a responsible way by cutting out spending we dont need,Claim

the way you define small businesses includes folks at the very top,Premise
what i now want to do is to hire more teachers especially in math and science,Claim
we know that weve fallen behind when it comes to math and science,Premise
those teachers can make a difference,Premise
if weve got math teachers who are able to provide the kind of support that they need for our kids thats whats going to determine whether or not the new businesses are created here,Claim
if you talk to teachers they will tell you it does make a difference,Premise
when you were asked about reduced class sizes you said class sizes dont make a difference,Premise
governor romney when you were asked by teachers whether or not this would help the economy grow you said this isnt going to help the economy grow,Premise
theyre starting to finally make progress,Premise
weve seen progress and gains in schools that were having a terrible time,Premise
you know under my leadership what weve done is reformed education working with governors 46 states,Premise
we know is going to make a difference in the 21st century and thats our education policy,Claim
companies are going to locate here depending on whether weve got the most highly skilled workforce,Premise
the kinds of budget proposals that youve put forward thats undermining our longterm competitiveness,Claim
when we dont ask either you or me to pay a dime more in terms of reducing the deficit but instead we slash support for education,Premise
that is not good for americas position in the world and the world notices,Claim
im so proud of the state that i had the chance to be governor of,Claim
fourth graders and eighth graders are tested in english and math,Premise
we have every two years tests that look at how well our kids are doing,Premise
while i was governor i was proud that our fourth graders came out number one of all 50 states in english and then also in math,Premise

first time one state had been number one in all four measures,Premise
how did we do that well republicans and democrats came together on a bipartisan basis to put in place education principles that focused on having great teachers in the classroom,Premise

states run these programs more efficiently,Claim
as a governor i thought please give me this program,Premise
i can run this more efficiently than the federal government,Premise
states by the way are proving it,Premise
states like arizona rhode island have taken these  these medicaid dollars,Premise
have shown they can run these programs more costeffectively,Premise
i want to do those two things and get this  get this to a balanced budget with eight  eight to 10 years,Claim
what you cant do is spend 2 trillion in additional military spending that the military is not asking for 5 trillion on tax cuts,Claim
the math simply doesnt work,Claim
then somehow youre also going to deal with the deficit that weve already got,Premise
you say that youre going to pay for it by closing loopholes and deductions without naming what those loopholes and deductions are,Premise
thats the budget that weve put forward,Premise
what i did was work with our joint chiefs of staff to think about what are we going to need in the future to make sure that we are safe,Premise
the math doesnt work,Claim
governor romneys called for 5 trillion of tax cuts that he says hes going to pay for by closing deductions,Premise
he continues to claim that hes going to do it,Premise
he then wants to spend another 2 trillion on military spending that our military is not asking for,Premise
keep in mind that our military spending has gone up every single year that ive been in office,Premise
the next 10,Premise
we spend more on our military than the next 10 countries combined china russia france the united kingdom you name it,Premise
when it comes to our military what we have to think about is not you know just budgets weve got to think about capabilities,Claim
thats exactly what our budget does,Claim
it also then allows us to reduce our deficit which is a significant national security concern,Claim
weve got to make sure that our economy is strong at home so that we can project military power overseas,Premise

four years in a row democrats and republicans came together to balance the budget,Premise
i had the chance to be governor of a state,Premise
im going to be able to balance the budget,Claim
i want to make sure that we have the ships that are required by our navy,Claim
thats unacceptable to me,Premise
were headed down to the low 200s if we go through a sequestration,Premise
were now at under 285,Premise
the navy said they needed 313 ships to carry out their mission,Premise
our navy is smaller now than at any time since 1917,Premise
i will not cut our military budget by a trillion dollars,Claim
it will not happen,Claim
the sequester is not something that ive proposed,Claim
it is something that congress has proposed,Premise
it is maintaining it,Premise
the budget that we are talking about is not reducing our military spending,Claim
which is a combination of the budget cuts the president has as well as the sequestration cuts,Claim
that in my view is making  is making our future less certain and less secure,Premise
this in my view is the highest responsibility of the president of the united states which is to maintain the safety of the american people,Premise
now were changing to one conflict,Premise
weve changed for the first time since fdr  since fdr we had the  weve always had the strategy of saying we could fight in two conflicts at once,Premise
our air force is older and smaller than at any time since it was founded in 1947,Premise
i think governor romney maybe hasnt spent enough time looking at how our military works,Claim
you mentioned the navy for example and that we have fewer ships than we did in 1916,Premise
the nature of our militarys changed,Claim
we also have fewer horses and bayonets,Premise
we have these things called aircraft carriers where planes land on them,Premise
we have these ships that go underwater nuclear submarines,Premise
the question is not a game of battleship where were counting slips,Claim
its what are our capabilities,Claim
that is not reflected in the kind of budget that youre putting forward because it just doesnt work,Claim
that also makes sure that our veterans have the kind of support that they need when they come home,Premise
when i sit down with the secretary of the navy and the joint chiefs of staff we determine how are we going to be best able to meet all of our defense needs in a way that also keeps faith with our troops,Premise
if israel is attacked america will stand with israel,Claim
it is our greatest ally in the region,Premise
israel is a true friend,Premise
ive made that clear throughout my presidency,Premise
i will stand with israel if they are attacked,Claim
as long as im president of the united states iran will not get a nuclear weapon,Claim
i made that clear when i came into office,Premise
in fact this week well be carrying out the largest military exercise with israel in history this very week,Premise
working with israel we have created the strongest military and intelligence cooperation between our two countries in history,Premise
it is crippling their economy,Claim
we then organized the strongest coalition and the strongest sanctions against iran in history,Premise
their currency has dropped 80 percent,Premise
their economy is in a shambles,Claim
their oil production has plunged to the lowest level since they were fighting a war with iraq 20 years ago,Premise
a nuclear iran is a threat to our national security and it is a threat to israels national security,Claim
we cannot afford to have a nuclear arms race in the most volatile region of the world,Premise
iran is a state sponsor of terrorism,Premise
for them to be able to provide nuclear technology to nonstate actors thats unacceptable,Claim
they have said that they want to see israel wiped off the map,Premise
i think that would be a mistake,Claim
when ive sent young men and women into harms way i always understand that that is the last resort not the first resort,Premise
the disagreement i have with governor romney is that during the course of this campaign hes often talked as if we should take premature military action,Premise
they can take the diplomatic route and end their nuclear program or they will have to face a united world and a united states president me who said were not going to take any options off the table,Claim
the work that weve done with respect to sanctions now offers iran a choice,Premise
if im president of the united states when im president of the united states we will stand with israel,Claim
if israel is attacked we have their back not just diplomatically not just culturally but militarily,Claim
a nuclear iran a nuclearcapable iran is unacceptable to america,Claim
it presents a threat not only to our friends but ultimately a threat to us to have iran have nuclear material nuclear weapons that could be used against us or used to be threatening to us,Premise
they do work,Claim
youre seeing it right now in the economy,Premise
its absolutely the right thing to do to have crippling sanctions,Claim
i would have put them in place earlier,Claim
i laid out seven steps crippling sanctions were number one,Premise
crippling sanctions are something i called for five years ago when i was in israel speaking at the herzliya conference,Premise
it is also essential for us to understand what our mission is in iran and that is to dissuade iran from having a nuclear weapon through peaceful and diplomatic means,Claim
its good that we have them,Claim
something i would add today is i would tighten those sanctions,Claim
i would tighten those sanctions further,Claim
not only ships couldnt but id say companies that are moving their oil cant people who are trading in their oil cant,Claim
i imagine the eu would agree with us as well,Premise
i would say that ships that carry iranian oil cant come into our ports,Claim
id take on diplomatic isolation efforts,Claim
id make sure that ahmadinejad is indicted under the genocide convention,Claim
i would indict him for it,Claim
his words amount to genocide incitation,Premise
i would also make sure that their diplomats are treated like the pariah they are around the world,Claim
the same way we treated the apartheid diplomats of south africa,Premise
we need to increase pressure time and time again on iran,Claim
anything other than a  a  a solution to this which says  which stops this  this nuclear folly of theirs is unacceptable to america,Premise
a military action is the last resort,Claim
it is something one would only  only consider if all of the other avenues had been  had been tried to their full extent,Premise
they are not true,Claim
those are reports in the newspaper,Premise
our goal is to get iran to recognize it needs to give up its nuclear program and abide by the un resolutions that have been in place,Claim
they have the opportunity to reenter the community of nations,Premise
we would welcome that,Claim
there are people in iran who have the same aspirations as people all around the world for a better life,Premise
we hope that their leadership takes the right decision,Premise
the deal well accept is they end their nuclear program,Claim
the work involved in setting up these crippling sanctions is painstaking,Claim
its meticulous,Claim
we started from the day we got into office,Premise
the reason is was so important  and this is a testament to how weve restored american credibility and strength around the world  is we had to make sure that all the countries participated even countries like russia and china,Premise
weve got to maintain that pressure,Claim
there is a deal to be had and that is that they abide by the rules that have already been established,Premise
we got everybody to agree that iran is seeing so much pressure,Claim
weve had sanctions in place a long time,Premise
they convince the international community they are not pursuing a nuclear program,Premise
there are inspections that are very intrusive,Premise
in the meantime though were not going to let up the pressure until we have clear evidence that that takes place,Claim
over time what they can do is regain credibility,Premise
the clock is ticking,Premise
were not going to allow iran to perpetually engage in negotiations that lead nowhere,Claim
ive been very clear to them,Premise
were going to make sure that if they do not meet the demands of the international community then we are going to take all options necessary to make sure they dont have a nuclear weapon,Claim
because of the intelligence coordination that we do with a range of countries including israel we have a sense of when they would get breakout capacity,Premise
which means that we would not be able to intervene in time to stop their nuclear program,Premise
and that clock is ticking,Premise
i think from the very beginning one of the challenges weve had with iran is that they have looked at this administration and felt that the administration was not as strong as it needed to be,Claim
i think they saw weakness where they had expected to find american strength,Claim
from the very beginning the president in his campaign four years ago said he would meet with all the worlds worst actors in his first year hed sit down with chavez and kim jongil with castro and president ahmadinejad of iran,Premise
then the president began what i have called an apology tour of going to various nations in the middle east and criticizing america,Premise

they must not develop nuclear capability,Claim
we need to indict ahmadinejad,Claim
our diplomatic isolation needs to be tougher,Claim

the way to make sure they understand that is by having from the very beginning the tightest sanctions possible,Claim
we need to put the pressure on them as hard as we possibly can,Claim
if we do that we wont have to take the military action,Premise
nothing governor romney just said is true starting with this notion of me apologizing,Claim
this has been probably the biggest whopper thats been told during the course of this campaign,Premise
every fact checker and every reporter whos looked at it governor has said this is not true,Premise
weve put in the toughest most crippling sanctions ever,Claim
with respect to our attitude about the iranian revolution i was very clear about the murderous activities that had taken place and that was contrary to international law and everything that civilized people stand for,Claim
while we were coordinating an international coalition to make sure these sanctions were effective you were still invested in a chinese state oil company that was doing business with the iranian oil sector,Premise
the strength that we have shown in iran is shown by the fact that weve been able to mobilize the world,Claim
iran is at its weakest point economically strategically militarily then since  then in many years,Premise

and then i went down to the border towns of storok ph which had experienced missiles raining dowm from hamas,Premise
i was reminded of what that would mean if those were my kids,Premise
i saw families there who showed me there where missiles had come down near their childrens bedrooms,Premise
thats how ive used my travels when i travel to israel and when i travel to the region,Claim
which is why as president we funded an iron dome program to stop those missiles,Premise
the president of the united states and the united states of america has stood on the right side of history,Claim
whether its supporting religious minorities,Premise
whether its supporting womens rights,Premise
whether its supporting democracy,Premise
whether its dealing with counterterrorism,Premise
whether its iran sanctions,Premise
they can look at my track record,Premise
that kind of credibility is precisely why weve been able to show leadership on a wide range of issues facing the world right now,Claim
my relationship with the prime minister of israel is such that we would not get a call saying our bombers are on the way or their fighters are on the way,Claim
this is the kind of thing that would have been discussed and thoroughly evaluated well before,Claim
lets come back to what the president was speaking about which is whats happening in the world and the presidents statement that things are going so well,Premise
i see syria with 30000 civilians dead assad still in power,Premise

theyre very strong,Claim
i see the middle east with a rising tide of violence chaos tumult,Premise
i look around the world and i dont feel that you see north korea continuing to export their nuclear technology russia said theyre not going to follow nunnlugar any more,Premise
i see our trade deficit with china larger than its  growing larger every year as a matter of fact,Premise
theyre back away from a nuclear proliferation treaty that we had with them,Premise
i dont see our influence growing around the world,Claim
i see our influence receding in part because of the failure of the president to deal with our economic challenges at home,Claim
 in part because of our withdrawal from our commitment to our military in the way i think it ought to be,Claim
in part because of the  the  the turmoil with israel,Claim
the president received a letter from 38 democrat senators saying the tensions with israel were a real problem,Premise
they asked him please repair the tension  democrat senators  please repair the tension the damage in his  in his own party,Premise
the problem is is that on a whole range of issues whether its the middle east whether its afghanistan whether its iraq whether its now iran youve been all over the map,Claim
im pleased that you now are endorsing our policy of applying diplomatic pressure and potentially having bilateral discussions with the iranians to end their nuclear program,Premise
in the same way that you initially opposed a timetable in afghanistan now youre for it although it depends,Premise
just a few years ago you said thats something youd never do,Premise
the same way that you said that it was mission creep to go after gadhafi,Premise
in the same way that you say you would have ended the war in iraq but recently gave a speech saying that we should have 20000 more folks in there,Premise
when it comes to going after osama bin laden you said well any president would make that call,Premise
but when you were a candidate in 2008 as i was and i said if i got bin laden in our sights i would take that shot you said we shouldnt move heaven and earth to get one man,Premise
you said we should ask pakistan for permission,Premise
it was worth moving heaven and earth to get him,Claim
if we had asked pakistan permission we would not have gotten him,Claim
after we killed bin laden i was at ground zero for a memorial and talked to a young women who was four years old when 911 happened,Premise
the last conversation she had with her father was him calling from the twin towers saying peyton ph i love you and i will always watch over you,Premise
and for the next decade she was haunted by that conversation,Premise
and she said to me you know by finally getting bin laden that brought some closure to me,Premise
when we do things like that  when we bring those who have harmed us to justice that sends a message to the world and it tells peyton ph that we did not forget her father,Premise
thats the kind of clarity of leadership,Claim
those decisions are not always popular,Claim
those decisions generally  generally are not polltested,Premise
even some in my own party including my current vice president had the same critique as you did,Premise
i look at what we need to get done to keep the american people safe and to move our interests forward and i make those decisions,Claim

we will make sure that we look at whats happening in pakistan and recognize that whats happening in pakistan is going to have a major impact on the success in afghanistan,Claim

pakistan is important to the region to the world and to us,Claim
pakistan has 100 nuclear warheads and theyre rushing to build a lot more,Premise
theyll have more than great britain sometime in the  in the relatively near future,Premise
they also have the haqqani network and the taliban existent within their country,Premise
a pakistan that falls apart becomes a failed state would be of extraordinary danger to afghanistan and to us,Claim
were going to have to remain helpful in encouraging pakistan to move towards a more stable government and rebuild the relationship with u,Claim
our aid that we provide to pakistan is going to have to be conditioned upon certain benchmarks being met,Claim
they will be ready by the end of 2014,Claim
that transition has to take place in a responsible fashion,Claim
were now in a position where we can transition out,Claim
theres no reason why americans should die when afghans are perfectly capable of defending their own country,Premise
we then started to build up afghan forces,Premise
we decimated al qaidas core leadership in the border regions between afghanistan and pakistan,Premise
we went because there were people who were responsible for 3000 american deaths,Premise
part of what had happened is wed forgotten why we had gone,Claim
we are now in a position where we have met many of the objectives that got us there in the first place,Claim
when i came into office we were still bogged down in iraq and afghanistan had been drifting for a decade,Premise
we ended the war in iraq refocused our attention on afghanistan and we did deliver a surge of troops,Premise
that was facilitated in part because we had ended the war in iraq,Premise
weve got to make sure that we and our coalition partners are pulling out responsibly and giving afghans the capabilities that they need,Claim
weve been there a long time,Premise
what i think the american people recognize is after a decade of war its time to do some nation building here at home,Claim
what we can now do is free up some resources to for example put americans back to work especially our veterans rebuilding our roads our bridges our schools,Premise
making sure that you know our veterans are getting the care that they need when it comes to posttraumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury,Premise
making sure that the certifications that they need for good jobs of the future are in place,Premise

a nation that has serious threats from terrorist groups within its nation as i indicated before the taliban haqqani network,Premise
its a nation thats not like  like others and it does not have a civilian leadership that is calling the shots there,Premise
you have the isi their intelligence organization is probably the most powerful of the  of three branches there,Premise
then you have the military and then you have the civilian government,Premise
this is a nation which if it falls apart if it  if it becomes a failed state there are nuclear weapons there and youve got  youve got terrorists there who could grab their  their hands onto those nuclear weapons,Premise
we do need to make sure that as we  as we send support for them that this is tied to them making progress on  on matters that would lead them to becoming a civil society,Claim
we cant just walk away from pakistan,Claim
thats one of the reasons the afghan security forces have so much work to do to be able to fight against that,Premise
theyre going to come rushing back in to afghanistan when we go,Premise
inside pakistan you have a  a large group of pashtun that are  that are taliban,Premise

i will continue to have,Claim
we need it badly,Claim
too many incumbent politicians in washington in both parties have consistently opposed campaign finance reform,Claim
that was certainly the case from the minute i got there,Premise
so after speaker gingrich and senator dole took over the congress i went to new hampshire and a man suggested  a gentleman that unfortunately just passed away a couple of days ago suggested that we appoint a commission,Premise
i shook hands with him on it and i appointed my members and the commission never met,Premise
then senator doles ardent supporters senator mccain whos out there today along with senator feingold supported sponsored a campaign finance reform proposal,Premise

i have consistently opposed the legalization of drugs all my public life and worked hard against them,Premise
i dont think this issue should be politicized,Claim
my record is clear,Premise
i dont think senator dole supports using using drugs,Claim
i think we just have to continue to work on this until those who think it isnt dangerous and wont kill them and wont destroy their lives get the message and change,Claim
you are very selective mr president,Claim
you dont want to politicize drugs but its already politicized medicare go out and scare senior citizens and other vulnerable groups veterans and people who get pell grants and things like this,Premise

which isnt the case,Claim
it seems to me the record is clear,Claim
the record is pretty clear in arkansas when you were governor,Claim

i believe with all respect i was right and he was wrong,Claim
this is a safer country,Claim
weve expanded the brady bill to cover people who beat up their spouses and their kids,Premise
two years later nobodys lost their handguns i mean their rifles,Premise
when we had the assault weapons ban in the senate senator dole fought it bitterly and opposed the entire crime bill and almost brought the entire crime bill down because the national rifle association didnt want the assault weapons ban just like they didnt want the brady bill,Premise
he didnt succeed and i signed it and im glad i did,Premise
he tried to keep it from coming to my desk,Premise
the brady bill has kept at least 60000 felons fugitives and stalkers from getting hand guns,Premise
senator dole led the fight against the brady bill,Premise

then cuba shot down two of our planes and murdered four people in international air space,Premise
they were completely beyond the pale of the law,Premise
i signed the helmsburton legislation,Premise

even when it finally got near passage senator kennedy held it up for 100 days because he wasnt satisfied with one provision,Premise
it will cover preexisting conditions,Premise

that sounds very good but its very wrong,Claim
we actually offered not to even put in a healthcare bill in 1994 uh 93 but instead to work with the senate republicans and write a joint bill,Premise
they got a memo from one of their political advisers saying that instead they should characterize whatever we did as big government and make sure nothing was done to aid healthcare before the 94 elections so they could make that claim,Premise
maybe we bit off more than we could chew,Premise
were pursuing a stepbystep reform now,Claim
the kennedykassebaum bill that i signed will make it possible for 25 million people to keep their health insurance when they change jobs or when somebody in their familys been sick,Premise

many of the provisions in the kassebaum bill were provisions that  my provisions,Claim
deductions for longterm care,Premise

what happened was one of the turkish one of the kurdish leaders invited him to go up north but we felt since the whole world community had told him not to do it that once he did it we had to do something,Premise
we did not feel that i could commit,Premise
that was the only way to do that,Claim
i certainly didnt feel i should commit american troops to throw him out of where he had gone,Premise
the appropriate thing strategically to do was to reduce his ability to threaten his neighbors,Claim
we did that by expanding whats called the nofly zone by increasing our allies control of the air space now from the kuwait border to the suburbs of baghdad,Premise
i believe it was,Claim
is it fully effective did it make him withdraw from the north well he does  he has a little bit and i hope he will continue,Premise
we have learned that you give him an inch hell take a mile,Premise
we had to do something,Claim
even though not all of our allies supported it at first i think most of them now believe that what we did was an appropriate thing to do,Claim
its a real problem,Claim
i dont understand extending the nofly zone in the south when the trouble was in the north,Premise

we did it without any of our allies that helped in the gulf,Premise

sometimes we cannot let other countries have a veto on our foreign policy,Claim
i still believe it was the right thing to do,Claim
i could not send soldiers into the north of iraq,Claim
it could reduce saddam husseins abilities to threaten kuwait and his other neighbors again,Premise
thats what i did,Premise
its not that we always disagree,Claim
ive supported the president when i thought he was right on bosnia,Premise
i supported him on nafta and gatt,Premise
others disagreed with us,Premise
i think we have lost credibility,Claim
i say this very honestly without any partisanship,Claim
weve lost credibility around the world,Claim
to me thats not the strategy that i think people expect from america,Claim
it seemed to me just as an observer that you know before youd call somebody to america youd have some notion what the end result might be,Premise
maybe its better just to get together and sit down and talk,Premise
maybe that was the purpose,Premise
i know talks have started again today,Premise
its almost like an ad hoc foreign policy,Premise
its ad hoc its sort of we get up in the morning and read the papers what countrys in trouble well have a meeting,Premise

so much trust has broken down in the aftermath of the change of government,Premise
today the secretary of state is in the middle east and theyve started negotiations and all those leaders promised me they would not quit until they resolved the issues between them and got the peace process going forward again,Premise

thats why weve got a country with ten and a half million more jobs and record numbers of new businesses and rising incomes and falling crime rates and welfare roll rates,Premise

we could have done at least 10 of them by now,Claim
i know from my experience in many campaigns that if senator obama had asked  responded to my urgent request to sit down and do town hall meetings and come before the american people,Premise
i think the tone of this campaign could have been very different,Claim
when senator obama was first asked he said any place any time the way barry goldwater and jack kennedy agreed to do before the intervention of the tragedy at dallas,Premise
it has taken many turns which i think are unacceptable,Claim

100 percent john of your ads  100 percent of them have been negative,Claim
its not true,Claim
it absolutely is true,Claim
i think the american people are less interested in our hurt feelings during the course of the campaign than addressing the issues that matter to them so deeply,Claim
there is nothing wrong with us having a vigorous debate like were having tonight about health care about energy policy about tax policy,Claim
thats the stuff that campaigns should be made of,Premise
what the american people cant afford though is four more years of failed economic policies,Claim
i dont mind being attacked for the next three weeks,Premise
the notion though that because were not doing town hall meetings that justifies some of the ads that have been going up not just from your own campaign directly john but 527s and other organizations that make some pretty tough accusations,Premise
what they deserve over the next four weeks is that we talk about whats most pressing to them the economic crisis,Claim
senator mccains own campaign said publicly last week that if we keep on talking about the economic crisis we lose so we need to change the subject,Premise

any objective observer has said its not true,Premise
youre running ads right now that say that i oppose federal funding for stem cell research,Premise

senator obama is spending unprecedented  unprecedented in the history of american politics going back to the beginning amounts of money in negative attack ads on me,Claim
im going to let him keep his wealth,Claim
ive been talking about the economy,Claim
ive talked to people like joe the plumber and tell him that im not going to spread his wealth around,Premise

thats what my campaign is all about and thats what itll continue to be all about,Claim
i do think that he inappropriately drew a comparison between what was happening there and what had happened during the civil rights movement,Claim
we immediately put out a statement saying that we dont think that comparison is appropriate,Premise
if we want to talk about congressman lewis who is an american hero he unprompted by my campaign without my campaigns awareness made a statement that he was troubled with what he was hearing at some of the rallies that your running mate was holding in which all the republican reports indicated were shouting when my name came up things like terrorist and kill him,Premise
youre running mate didnt mention didnt stop didnt say hold on a second thats kind of out of line,Premise
i think congressman lewis point was that we have to be careful about how we deal with our supporters,Premise
afterwards congressman lewis put out a similar statement saying that he had probably gone over the line,Premise
the american people have become so cynical about our politics because all they see is a tit fortat and backandforth,Claim
what they want is the ability to just focus on some really big challenges that we face right now,Claim
thats what i have been trying to focus on this entire campaign,Premise
i have repudiated every time someones been out of line whether theyve been part of my campaign or not,Premise
i will continue to do that,Claim
we need to absolutely not stand for the kind of things that have been going on,Claim

weve always said that thats not appropriate,Premise
somehow say that group of young women who said military wives for mccain are somehow saying anything derogatory about you but anything,Premise
those veterans that wear those hats that say world war ii vietnam korea iraq,Premise
im not going to stand for people saying that the people that come to my rallies are anything but the most dedicated patriotic men and women that are in this nation and theyre great citizens,Claim
im not going to stand for somebody saying that because someone yelled something at a rally,Claim
theres a lot of things that have been yelled at your rallies senator obama that im not happy about either,Premise
what i think is most important is that we recognize that to solve the key problems that were facing democrats independents and republicans were going to have to be able to work together,Claim
if were going to solve two wars the worst financial crisis since the great depression,Premise
if were going to focus on lifting wages that have declined over the last eight years and create jobs here in america,Premise
what is important is making sure that we disagree without being disagreeable,Claim
we can have tough vigorous debates around issues,Claim
what we cant do i think is try to characterize each other as bad people,Claim
that has been a culture in washington that has been taking place for too long,Premise
all of these things need to be examined of course,Claim
i dont care about an old washedup terrorist,Premise
as senator clinton said in her debates with you we need to know the full extent of that relationship,Premise
we need to know the full extent of senator obamas relationship with acorn,Claim
who is now on the verge of maybe perpetrating one of the greatest frauds in voter history in this country maybe destroying the fabric of democracy,Premise
the same front outfit organization that your campaign gave 832000 for lighting and site selection,Premise
he will not advise me in the white house,Claim
mr ayers is not involved in my campaign,Claim
he has never been involved in this campaign,Claim
it had nothing to do with us,Claim
mr ayers has become the centerpiece of senator mccains campaign over the last two or three weeks,Claim
this has been their primary focus,Claim
lets get the record straight,Premise
bill ayers is a professor of education in chicago,Premise
forty years ago when i was 8 years old he engaged in despicable acts with a radical domestic group,Premise
i have roundly condemned those acts,Premise
ten years ago he served and i served on a school reform board that was funded by one of ronald reagans former ambassadors and close friends mr annenberg,Premise
other members on that board were the presidents of the university of illinois the president of northwestern university who happens to be a republican the president of the chicago tribune a republican leaning newspaper,Premise
acorn is a community organization,Premise
apparently what theyve done is they were paying people to go out and register folks and apparently some of the people who were out there didnt really register people they just filled out a bunch of names,Premise
we were not involved,Claim
the only involvement ive had with acorn was i represented them alongside the us justice department in making illinois implement a motor voter law that helped people get registered at dmvs,Premise
i think that its important to just get these facts out,Claim
the allegation that senator mccain has continually made is that somehow my associations are troubling,Premise
on economic policy i associate with warren buffett and former fed chairman paul volcker,Claim
i associate myself with my running mate joe biden or with dick lugar the republican ranking member on the senate foreign relations committee or general jim jones the former supreme allied commander of nato,Claim
if im interested in figuring out my foreign policy,Premise
those are the people democrats and republicans who have shaped my ideas and who will be surrounding me in the white house,Claim
i think the fact that this has become such an important part of your campaign senator mccain says more about your campaign than it says about me,Claim
thats absolutely not true,Claim
thats not the facts,Claim
while you were on the board of the woods foundation you and mr ayers together you sent 230000 to acorn,Claim
you launched your political campaign in mr ayers living room,Claim
all of the details need to be known about senator obamas relationship with them and with acorn,Claim
its not the fact that senator obama chooses to associate with a guy who in 2001 said that he wished he had have bombed more and he had a long association with him,Premise
the american people will make a judgment,Claim
my campaign is about getting this economy back on track,Claim
about creating jobs,Claim
about a brighter future for america,Claim
thats what my campaign is about,Claim
im not going to raise taxes the way senator obama wants to raise taxes in a tough economy,Claim
thats really what this campaign is going to be about,Claim
joe biden i think is one of the finest public servants that has served in this country,Claim
its not just that he has some of the best foreign policy credentials of anybody,Premise
democrats and republicans alike i think acknowledge his expertise there,Premise
his entire life he has never forgotten where he came from coming from scranton fighting on behalf of working families remembering what its like to see his father lose his job and go through a downward spiral economically,Premise
as a consequence his consistent pattern throughout his career is to fight for the little guy,Premise
thats what hes done when it comes to economic policies that will help working families get a leg up,Premise
thats what hes done when it comes to for example passing the landmark 1994 crime bill the violence against womens act,Premise
joe has always made sure that he is fighting on behalf of working families,Premise
i think he shares my core values and my sense of where the country needs to go,Claim
after eight years of failed policies he and i both agree that what were going to have to do is to reprioritize,Claim
make sure that were investing in the american people,Claim
give tax cuts not to the wealthiest corporations but give them to small businesses and give them to individuals who are struggling right now,Claim
make sure that we finally get serious about energy independence,Claim
something that has been languishing in washington for 30 years,Premise
make sure that our kids get a great education and can afford to go to college,Claim
on the key issues that are of importance to american families joe bidens always been on the right side,Claim
i think he will make an outstanding president if heaven forbid something happened to me,Claim
shes a reformer,Claim
shes a role model to women and other  and reformers all over america,Claim

she negotiated with the oil companies and faced them down a 40 billion pipeline of natural gas thats going to relieve the energy needs of the united  of what they call the lower 48,Premise
shes a reformer through and through,Claim
its time we had that bresh of freth air sic  breath of fresh air coming into our nations capital and sweep out the oldboy network and the cronyism thats been so much a part of it that ive fought against for all these years,Claim
shell be my partner,Claim
she understands reform,Claim
she also understands specialneeds families,Claim
she understands that autism is on the rise that weve got to find out whats causing it,Premise
weve got to reach out to these families and help them and give them the help they need as they raise these very special needs children,Premise
she understands that better than almost any american that i know,Claim
she has ignited our party and people all over america that have never been involved in the political process,Premise
i think that obviously shes a capable politician who has i think excited the  a base in the republican party,Claim
i think its very commendable the work shes done on behalf of special needs,Claim
i agree with that,Premise
if we have an acrosstheboard spending freeze were not going to be able to do it,Claim
thats an example of i think the kind of use of the scalpel that we want to make sure that were funding some of those programs,Premise
that is something that every family that advocates on behalf of disabled children talk about,Premise
i do want to just point out that autism for example or other special needs will require some additional funding,Claim
if were going to get serious in terms of research,Premise
i think that joe biden is qualified in many respects,Claim
i do point out that hes been wrong on many foreign policy and national security issues which is supposed to be his strength,Claim
he voted against the first gulf war,Premise
he voted against it and obviously we had to take saddam hussein out of kuwait or it wouldve threatened the middle eastern world supply,Premise
in iraq he had this cockamamie idea about dividing iraq into three countries,Premise
were seeing iraq united as iraqis tough hard but were seeing them,Premise
were now about to have an agreement for status of forces in iraq coming up,Premise
hes been wrong on a number of the major ones,Claim
there are several issues in which frankly joe biden and i openly and honestly disagreed on national security policy,Premise
i believe we can for all intents and purposes eliminate our dependence on middle eastern oil and venezuelan oil,Claim
you dont tell countries youre going to unilaterally renegotiate agreements with them,Claim
when senator obama said he would unilaterally renegotiate the north american free trade agreement the canadians said yes and well sell our oil to china,Premise
we can eliminate our dependence on foreign oil by building 45 new nuclear plants power plants right away,Premise
we can store and we can reprocess,Premise
senator obama will tell you in the  as the extreme environmentalists do it has to be safe,Premise
we can store and reprocess spent nuclear fuel senator obama no problem,Claim
weve sailed navy ships around the world for 60 years with nuclear power plants on them,Premise
i think we can easily within seven eight ten years if we put our minds to it we can eliminate our dependence on the places in the world that harm our national security if we dont achieve our independence,Claim
with nuclear power with wind tide solar natural gas with development of flex fuel hybrid clean coal technology clean coal technology is key in the heartland of america thats hurting rather badly,Claim
i think that in ten years we can reduce our dependence so that we no longer have to import oil from the middle east or venezuela,Claim
i think thats about a realistic timeframe,Claim
this is the most important issue that our future economy is going to face,Claim
weve got an immediate crisis right now,Premise
nothing is more important than us no longer borrowing 700 billion or more from china and sending it to saudi arabia,Claim
its mortgaging our childrens future,Premise
from the start of this campaign ive identified this as one of my top priorities,Premise
we do need to expand domestic production,Claim
that means for example telling the oil companies the 68 million acres that they currently have leased that theyre not drilling use them or lose them,Premise
i think that we should look at offshore drilling and implement it in a way that allows us to get some additional oil,Claim
we only have three to four percent of the worlds oil reserves and we use 25 percent of the worlds oil,Premise
we cant drill our way out of the problem,Claim
these have been priorities of mine since i got to the senate,Premise
it is absolutely critical that we develop a high fuel efficient car thats built not in japan and not in south korea but built here in the united states of america,Claim
ive focused on putting resources into solar wind biodiesel geothermal,Claim
we invented the auto industry,Premise
the fact that we have fallen so far behind is something that we have to work on,Claim
i believe in free trade,Claim
i also believe that for far too long certainly during the course of the bush administration with the support of senator mccain the attitude has been that any trade agreement is a good trade agreement,Claim
nafta doesnt have  did not have enforceable labor agreements and environmental agreements,Premise
we should include those and make them enforceable,Claim
we should enforce rules against china manipulating its currency to make our exports more expensive and their exports to us cheaper,Claim
when it comes to south korea weve got a trade agreement up right now they are sending hundreds of thousands of south korean cars into the united states,Premise
we can only get 4000 to 5000 into south korea,Premise
that is not free trade,Claim
i make no apology for that,Claim
weve got to have a president who is going to be advocating on behalf of american businesses and american workers,Claim
you really have to pay attention to words,Claim
i admire so much senator obamas eloquence,Premise
he said we will look at offshore drilling,Premise
did you get that look at,Premise
we can offshore drill now,Premise
weve got to do it now,Claim
we will reduce the cost of a barrel of oil,Claim
we show the world that we have a supply of our own,Premise
its doable,Claim
the technology is there,Premise
we have to drill now,Claim
we need to have education and training programs for displaced workers that work going to our community colleges,Claim
free trade with colombia is something thats a nobrainer,Claim
you ought to travel down there and visit them,Claim
maybe you could understand it a lot better,Premise
let me give you another example of a free trade agreement that senator obama opposes,Premise
right now because of previous agreements some made by president clinton the goods and products that we send to colombia which is our largest agricultural importer of our products is  theres a billion dollars that we  our businesses have paid so far in order to get our goods in there,Premise
because of previous agreements their goods and products come into our country for free,Premise
senator obama who has never traveled south of our border opposes the colombia free trade agreement,Premise
the same country thats helping us try to stop the flow of drugs into our country thats killing young americans,Premise
the country that just freed three americans,Premise
that will help us create jobs in america,Claim
they will be a market for our goods and products without having to pay  without us having to pay the billions of dollars  the billion dollars and more that weve already paid,Premise
i understand it pretty well,Claim
i think that the important point is weve got to have a president who understands the benefits of free trade but also is going to enforce unfair trade agreements and is going to stand up to other countries,Claim
we have to stand for human rights,Claim
we have to make sure that violence isnt being perpetrated against workers who are just trying to organize for their rights,Claim
which is why for example i supported the peruvian free trade agreement which was a wellstructured agreement,Premise
the free trade  the trade agreement itself does have labor and environmental protections,Premise
the history in colombia right now is that labor leaders have been targeted for assassination on a fairly consistent basis and there have not been prosecutions,Premise
i think its important for us to get loan guarantees to the automakers,Claim
the automakers they are obviously getting hammered right now,Premise
they were already having a tough time,Claim
because of high gas prices,Premise
now with the financial crisis car dealerships are closing and people cant get car loans,Premise
we do have to hold them responsible,Claim
as well to start producing the highly fuelefficient cars of the future,Claim
its going to be one of my highest priorities,Claim
transportation accounts for about 30 percent of our total energy consumption,Premise
if we can get that right,Premise
we can move in a direction not only of energy independence,Claim
we can create 5 million new jobs all across america including in the heartland,Claim
where we can retool some of these plants to make these highly fuelefficient cars and also to make wind turbines and solar panels the kinds of clean energy approaches that should be the driver of our economy for the next century,Premise
i dont think theres any doubt that senator obama wants to restrict trade and he wants to raise taxes,Claim
senator obama doesnt want a free trade agreement with our best ally in the region but wants to sit down across the table without precondition to  with hugo chavez the guy who has been helping farc the terrorist organization,Premise
free trade between ourselves and colombia i just recited to you the benefits of concluding that agreement a billion dollars of american dollars that could have gone to creating jobs and businesses in the united states opening up those markets,Premise
the last president of the united states that tried that was herbert hoover,Premise
we went from a deep recession into a depression,Premise
were not going to follow that path while im  when im president of the united states,Claim
weve got to do both,Claim
thats exactly what my plan does,Claim
as i travel around the country this is the issue that will break your heart over and over again,Premise
just yesterday i was in toledo shaking some hands in a line,Premise
two women both of them probably in their mid to late50s had just been laid off of their plant,Premise
neither of them have health insurance,Premise
they were desperate for some way of getting coverage because understandably theyre worried that if they get sick they could go bankrupt,Premise
the only thing were going to try to do is lower costs so that those cost savings are passed onto you,Claim
we can cut the average familys premium by about 2500 per year,Claim
if you dont have health insurance then what were going to do is to provide you the option of buying into the same kind of federal pool that both senator mccain and i enjoy as federal employees,Claim
which will give you highquality care choice of doctors at lower costs,Claim
so many people are part of this insured group,Premise
if you have health insurance then you dont have to do anything,Claim
if youve got health insurance through your employer you can keep your health insurance keep your choice of doctor keep your plan,Claim
were going to make sure that insurance companies cant discriminate on the basis of preexisting conditions,Claim
well negotiate with the drug companies for the cheapest available price on drugs,Claim
we are going to invest in information technology to eliminate bureaucracy and make the system more efficient,Claim
we are going to make sure that we manage chronic illnesses like diabetes and heart disease that cost a huge amount but could be prevented,Claim

i exempt small businesses from having to pay into a kitty,Premise
the average family is paying an additional 900 a year in higher premiums because of the uninsured,Premise
large businesses that can afford it weve got a choice,Premise
either they provide health insurance to their employees or somebody has to,Premise
right now what happens is those employees get dumped into either the medicaid system which taxpayers pick up or theyre going to the emergency room for uncompensated care which everybody picks up in their premiums,Premise
we exempt small businesses,Claim
if you want to do the right thing with your employees and you want to provide them health insurance,Premise
well give you a 50 percent credit so that you will actually be able to afford it,Claim
you will be able to buy into the plan that i just described,Claim

whats going to end up happening is that youre going to be the only ones left in your employerbased system your employers wont be able to afford it,Claim
once youre out on your own with this 5000 credit senator mccain for the first time is going to be taxing the health care benefits that you have from your employer,Claim
insurers right now the main restrictions on what they do is primarily state law and under senator mccains plan those rules would be stripped away and you would start seeing a lot more insurance companies cherrypicking and excluding people from coverage,Premise
that i think is a mistake,Claim
i think that this is a fundamental difference in our campaign and how we would approach health care,Claim
you will then fall into the category where youll have to pay a fine if you dont provide health insurance that senator obama mandates not the kind that you think is best for your family your children your employees but the kind that he mandates for you,Claim
95 percent of the people in america will receive more money under my plan,Claim
they will receive not only their present benefits which may be taxed which will be taxed,Claim
then you add 5000 onto it,Claim
except for those people who have the goldplated cadillac insurance policies that have to do with cosmetic surgery and transplants and all of those kinds of things,Premise
theyll be able to go across america,Claim
the average cost of a health care insurance plan in america today is 5800,Premise
im going to give them 5000 to take with them wherever they want to go,Premise
this will give them affordability,Claim
this will give them availability,Claim
this will give them a chance to choose their own futures,Claim
not have senator obama and government decide that for them,Premise
senator obama wants government to do the job,Premise
senator obama wants government to do the job,Premise
this really gets down to the fundamental difference in our philosophies,Claim
i want joe you to do the job,Premise
i want to leave money in your pocket,Claim
i want you to be able to choose the health care for you and your family,Claim
thats what im all about,Claim
weve got too much government and too much spending,Claim
the size of government has grown by 40 percent in the last eight years,Premise
we cant afford that in the next eight years,Claim
with the democrats in charge of congress things have gotten worse,Premise
theyve been in charge the last two years,Premise
under senator mccains plan there is a strong risk that people would lose their employerbased health care,Claim
you all just heard my plan,Premise
if youve got an employerbased health care plan you keep it,Claim
thats the choice youll have is having your employer no longer provide you health care,Premise
the us chamber of commerce which generally doesnt support a lot of democrats said that this plan could lead to the unraveling of the employerbased health care system,Premise
all i want to do if youve already got health care is lower your costs,Claim
that includes you joe,Premise
i would never and have never in all the years ive been there imposed a litmus test on any nominee to the court,Claim
thats not appropriate to do,Claim
i think there were a lot of decisions that were bad,Claim
i think that decisions should rest in the hands of the states,Claim
i thought it was a bad decision,Claim
im a federalist,Premise
i believe strongly that we should have nominees to the united states supreme court based on their qualifications rather than any litmus test,Claim
thats not the way we should judge these nominees,Claim
i will find the best people in the world  in the united states of america who have a history of strict adherence to the constitution,Claim
not legislating from the bench,Claim
they should be judged on their qualifications,Premise
elections have consequences,Premise
thats what i will do,Claim
there was a time a few years ago when the united states senate was about to blow up,Premise
senator obama voted against justice breyer and justice roberts on the grounds that they didnt meet his ideological standards,Premise
this is a very important issue were talking about,Premise
not because i agreed with their ideology but because i thought they were qualified and that elections have consequences when presidents are nominated,Premise
i voted for justice breyer and justice ginsburg,Premise
you chose not to because you were afraid of the appointment of quote conservative judges,Premise
you were offered a chance to join,Premise
we got together seven republicans seven democrats,Premise
republicans wanted to have just a majority vote to confirm a judge and the democrats were blocking in an unprecedented fashion,Premise
i would consider anyone in their qualifications,Claim
i do not believe that someone who has supported roe v wade that would be part of those qualifications,Claim
i certainly would not impose any litmus test,Claim
i think its true that we shouldnt apply a strict litmus test and the most important thing in any judge is their capacity to provide fairness and justice to the american people,Claim
it is true that this is going to be i think one of the most consequential decisions of the next president,Claim
it is very likely that one of us will be making at least one and probably more than one appointments and roe versus wade probably hangs in the balance,Premise
i would not provide a litmus test,Claim
i am somebody who believes that roe versus wade was rightly decided,Claim
i think that abortion is a very difficult issue and it is a moral issue and one that i think good people on both sides can disagree on,Claim
what ultimately i believe is that women in consultation with their families their doctors their religious advisers are in the best position to make this decision,Claim
i think that the constitution has a right to privacy in it that shouldnt be subject to state referendum,Claim
any more than our first amendment rights are subject to state referendum,Premise
any more than many of the other rights that we have should be subject to popular vote,Premise
this is going to be an important issue,Claim
i will look for those judges who have an outstanding judicial record,Claim
who have the intellect,Claim
who hopefully have a sense of what realworld folks are going through,Claim
ill just give you one quick example,Premise
senator mccain and i disagreed recently when the supreme court made it more difficult for a woman named lilly ledbetter to press her claim for pay discrimination,Premise
for years she had been getting paid less than a man had been paid for doing the exact same job,Premise
when she brought a suit saying equal pay for equal work the judges said well you know its taken you too long to bring this lawsuit even though she didnt know about it until fairly recently,Premise
we tried to overturn it in the senate,Premise
i supported that effort to provide better guidance to the courts john mccain opposed it,Premise
i think that its important for judges to understand that if a woman is out there trying to raise a family trying to support her family and is being treated unfairly then the court has to stand up if nobody else will,Claim
thats the kind of judge that i want,Claim
we have to change the culture of america,Claim
those of us who are proudly prolife understand that,Premise
it was clearcut votes that senator obama voted i think in direct contradiction to the feelings and views of mainstream america,Claim
thats his record,Claim
its got to be courage and compassion that we show to a young woman whos facing this terribly difficult decision,Claim
senator obama as a member of the illinois state senate voted in the judiciary committee against a law that would provide immediate medical attention to a child born of a failed abortion,Premise
he voted against that,Premise
then on the floor of the state senate as he did 130 times as a state senator he voted present,Premise
then there was another bill before the senate judiciary committee in the state of illinois not that long ago where he voted against a ban on partialbirth abortion one of the lateterm abortion a really  one of the bad procedures a terrible,Premise
then on the floor of the illinois state senate he voted present,Premise
i dont know how you vote present on some of that,Premise
i dont know how you align yourself with the extreme aspect of the pro abortion movement in america,Premise
its not true,Claim
if it sounds incredible that i would vote to withhold lifesaving treatment from an infant,Premise
there was a bill that was put forward before the illinois senate that said you have to provide lifesaving treatment and that would have helped to undermine roe v wade,Premise
there was already a law on the books in illinois that required providing lifesaving treatment,Premise
which is why not only myself but prochoice republicans and democrats voted against it,Premise
the illinois medical society the organization of doctors in illinois voted against it,Premise
their hippocratic oath would have required them to provide care and there was already a law in the books,Premise
with respect to partialbirth abortion i am completely supportive of a ban on lateterm abortions partialbirth or otherwise as long as theres an exception for the mothers health and life,Claim
this did not contain that exception,Premise
i attempted as many have in the past of including that so that it is constitutional,Premise
that was rejected,Premise
i voted present,Premise
im willing to support a ban on lateterm abortions as long as we have that exception,Claim
i think thats where we can find some common ground,Claim
nobodys proabortion,Premise
this is an issue that  look it divides us,Premise
in some ways it may be difficult to  to reconcile the two views,Premise
there surely is some common ground when both those who believe in choice and those who are opposed to abortion can come together and say we should try to prevent unintended pregnancies by providing appropriate education to our youth communicating that sexuality is sacred and that they should not be engaged in cavalier activity and providing options for adoption and helping single mothers if they want to choose to keep the baby,Premise
those are all things that we put in the democratic platform for the first time this year,Premise
we should try to reduce these circumstances,Claim
its always a tragic situation,Premise
just again the example of the eloquence of senator obama,Premise
hes health for the mother,Premise
thats been stretched by the proabortion movement in america to mean almost anything,Claim
thats the extreme proabortion position quote health,Premise
cindy and i are adoptive parents,Premise
we know what a treasure and joy it is to have an adopted child in our lives,Premise
well do everything we can to improve adoption in this country,Claim
that does not mean that we will cease to protect the rights of the unborn,Premise
we have to come together,Claim
we have to work together,Claim
its vital that we do so and help these young women who are facing such a difficult decision,Claim
with a compassion that well help them with the adoptive services with the courage to bring that child into this world and well help take care of it,Premise
this probably has more to do with our economic future than anything,Claim
that means it also has a national security implication,Claim
theres never been a nation on earth that saw its economy decline and continued to maintain its primacy as a military power,Premise
weve got to get our education system right,Claim
i think we need both,Claim
in some cases we are going to have to invest,Claim
early childhood education which closes the achievement gap so that every child is prepared for school every dollar we invest in that we end up getting huge benefits with improved reading scores reduced dropout rates reduced delinquency rates,Premise
i think its going to be critically important for us to recruit a generation of new teachers an army of new teachers especially in math and science give them higher pay give them more professional development and support in exchange for higher standards and accountability,Claim
i think its important for us to make college affordable,Claim
i meet young people all across the country who either have decided not to go to college,Premise
if theyre going to college they are taking on 20000 30000 50000 60000 worth of debt,Premise
its very difficult for them to go into some fields like basic research in science for example thinking to themselves that theyre going to have a mortgage before they even buy a house,Premise
if we do those things then i believe that we can create a better school system,Claim
ive proposed a 4000 tuition credit every student every year in exchange for some form of community service whether its military service whether its peace corps whether its working in a community,Claim
theres one last ingredient that i just want to mention and thats parents,Premise
we cant do it just in the schools,Premise
parents are going to have to show more responsibility,Claim
theyve got to turn off the tv set put away the video games and finally start instilling that thirst for knowledge that our students need,Premise
choice and competition amongst schools is one of the key elements,Claim
thats already been proven in places in like new orleans and new york city and other places where we have charter schools where we take good teachers and we reward them and promote them,Premise
we find bad teachers another line of work,Premise
we have to be able to give parents the same choice frankly that senator obama and mrs obama had and cindy and i had to send our kids to the school  their kids to the school of their choice,Claim
charter schools arent the only answer but theyre providing competition,Premise
they are providing the kind of competitions that have upgraded both schools  types of schools,Premise
throwing money at the problem is not the answer,Claim
you will find that some of the worst school systems in america get the most money per student,Premise
i believe that we need to reward these good teachers,Claim
we need to encourage programs such as teach for america and troops to teachers where people after having served in the military can go right to teaching and not have to take these examinations which  or have the certification that some are required in some states,Premise
we need to make those student loans available,Claim
we need to give them a repayment schedule that they can meet,Claim
we need to have full student loan program for instate tuition,Claim
we certainly need to adjust the certain loan eligibility to inflation,Claim
i do think that it is important for the federal government to step up and help local school districts do some of the things they need to do,Claim
we have a tradition of local control of the schools and thats a tradition that has served us well,Premise
we tried to do this under president bush,Premise
he put forward no child left behind,Premise
they left the money behind for no child left behind,Premise
local school districts end up having more of a burden a bunch of unfunded mandates,Premise
the same kind of thing that happened with special education where we did the right thing by saying every school should provide education to kids with special needs but we never followed through on the promise of funding and that left local school districts very cashstrapped,Premise
what i want to do is focus on early childhood education providing teachers higher salaries in exchange for more support,Claim
i think its important to foster competition inside the public schools,Claim
senator mccain and i actually agree on two things that he just mentioned,Premise
charter schools i doubled the number of charter schools in illinois despite some reservations from teachers unions,Premise
we also agree on the need for making sure that if we have bad teachers that they are swiftly  after given an opportunity to prove themselves,Claim
if they cant hack it then we need to move on,Claim
our kids have to have their best future,Premise
i dont think americas youth are interest groups,Claim
i think theyre our future,Claim
recently his key economic adviser was asked about why he didnt seem to have some specific programs to help young people go to college and the response was well you know we cant give money to every interest group that comes along,Premise
i also have to disagree on senator mccains record when it comes to college accessibility and affordability,Premise
where we disagree is on the idea that we can somehow give out vouchers  give vouchers as a way of securing the problems in our education system,Premise
if were going to do some of the things you mentioned like lowering loan rates or what have you somebody has got to pay for it,Claim
its not going to happen on its own,Premise
we cant say were going to do things and then not explain in concrete terms how were going to pay for it,Claim
this is an example of where we are going to have to prioritize,Premise
spending more money isnt always the answer,Claim
we need to sit down and reauthorize it,Claim
i think the head start program is a great program,Claim
as far as the no child left behind is concerned it was a great first beginning in my view,Claim
they wanted to choose the school that they thought was best for their children,Claim
they wanted to have the same choice that you and i and cindy and your wife have had,Premise
im sure youre aware senator obama of the program in the washington dc school system where vouchers are provided and theres a certain number i think its a thousand and some and some 9000 parents asked to be eligible for that,Premise
im frankly surprised you didnt pay more attention to that example,Premise
it had its flaws,Premise
it had its problems,Premise
the first time we had looked at the issue of education in america from a nationwide perspective,Premise
we need to fix a lot of the problems,Claim
lets reform it,Claim
lets reform it and fund it,Claim
by the third grade many times children who were in the head start program arent any better off than the others,Premise
a lot of people including me said look its not doing what it should do,Premise
that was of course outofbounds by the democrats,Premise
we need to reform these programs,Claim
we need to have transparency,Claim
we need to have rewards,Claim
its a system that cries out for accountability and transparency and the adequate funding,Premise
town hall meeting after town hall meeting parents come with kids children  precious children who have autism,Premise
sarah palin knows about that better than most,Premise
well find and well spend the money research to find the cause of autism,Claim
well care for these young children,Claim
all americans will open their wallets and their hearts to do so,Claim
to have a situation as you mentioned in our earlier comments that the most expensive education in the world is in the united states of america also means that it cries out for reform,Premise
i will support those reforms,Claim
i will fund the ones that are reformed,Claim
im not going to continue to throw money at a problem,Claim
ive got to tell you that vouchers where they are requested and where they are agreed to are a good and workable system,Claim
its been proven,Premise
senator mccains absolutely right the dc school system is in terrible shape,Premise
it has been for a very long time,Premise
she supports vouchers,Claim
who supports vouchers,Claim
weve got a wonderful new superintendent there whos working very hard with the young mayor there,Premise
who initiated  actually supports charters,Claim
i disagree with him on this,Claim
the data doesnt show that it actually solves the problem,Premise
even if senator mccain were to say that vouchers were the way to go,Premise
the centerpiece of senator mccains education policy is to increase the voucher program in dc by 2000 slots,Premise
that leaves all of you who live in the other 50 states without an education reform policy from senator mccain,Premise
weve got to have a president who is going to tackle it headon,Claim
thats what i intend to do as president,Claim
theres not enough vouchers therefore we shouldnt do it even though its working,Premise
i think weve had a very healthy discussion,Claim
america needs a new direction,Claim
these are very difficult times and challenges for america,Premise
they were graphically demonstrated again today,Premise
we cannot be satisfied with what weve been doing for the last eight years,Claim
i have a record of reform,Premise
taking on my party the other party the special interests whether it be an hmo patients bill of rights or trying to clean up the campaign finance system in  in this country or whether it be establishment of a 911 commission i have a long record of it,Premise
ive been a careful steward of your tax dollars,Premise
we have to make health care affordable and available,Claim
we have to make quality education there for all of our citizens not just the privileged few,Claim
we have to stop the spending,Claim
which has mortgaged your childrens futures,Premise
ive spent my entire life in the service of this nation and putting my country first,Premise
thereâ€™s a long line of mccains that have served our country for a long time in war and in peace,Premise
its been the great honor of my life and ive been proud to serve,Premise
ive asked you not only to examine my record but my proposals for the future of this country,Claim
all of these things and all the promises and commitments that senator obama and i made inaudible made to you tonight will base  will be based on whether you can trust us or not to be careful stewards of your tax dollar,Premise
to make sure america is safe and secure and prosperous,Premise
to make sure we reform the institutions of government,Premise
i hope youll give me an opportunity to serve again,Premise
id be honored and humbled,Claim
the policies of the last eight years and  and washingtons unwillingness to tackle the tough problems for decades has left us in the worst economic crisis since the great depression,Premise
we all know america is going through tough times right now,Premise
the biggest risk we could take right now is to adopt the same failed policies and the same failed politics that weve seen over the last eight years and somehow expect a different result,Claim
we need fundamental change in this country,Claim
thats what id like to bring,Claim
over the last 20 months youve invited me into your homes,Premise
youve shared your stories with me,Premise
youve confirmed once again the fundamental decency and generosity of the american people,Premise
im sure that our brighter days are still ahead,Claim
were going to have to invest in the american people again,Claim
in tax cuts for the middle class,Claim
in health care for all americans,Claim
college for every young person who wants to go,Claim
in businesses that can create the new energy economy of the future,Claim
in policies that will lift wages and will grow our middle class,Claim
these are the policies i have fought for my entire career,Premise
these are the policies i want to bring to the white house,Claim
its not going to be easy,Claim
its not going to be quick,Claim
it is going to be requiring all of us  democrats republicans independents  to come together and to renew a spirit of sacrifice and service and responsibility,Claim
im absolutely convinced we can do it,Claim
i promise you that if you give me the extraordinary honor of serving as your president i will work every single day tirelessly on your behalf and on the behalf of the future of our children,Claim
i believe that the question oversimplifies the difficulties of what we must do in central america,Claim
our objectives ought to be to strengthen the democracies,Premise
we need a threepronged attack,Claim
one is military assistance to our friends who are being pressured,Premise
secondly a strong and sophisticated economic aid program and human rights program that offers a better life and a sharper alternative to the alternative offered by the totalitarians who oppose us,Premise
finally a strong diplomatic effort that pursues the possibilities of peace in the area,Premise
they have not pursued the diplomatic opportunities either within el salvador or as between the countries and have lost time during which we might have been able to achieve a peace,Premise
i think the lesson in central america this recent embarrassment in nicaragua where we are giving instructions for hired assassins hiring criminals and the rest  all of this has strengthened our opponents,Claim
a president must not only assure that were tough but we must also be wise and smart in the exercise of that power,Premise
we saw the same thing in lebanon where we spent a good deal of americas assets,Premise
the president must be in command,Premise
we absolutely must,Claim
thats a classic example of a strategy thats embarrassed us,Premise
weve seen in the nicaraguan example a policy that has actually hurt us,Premise
hes supposed to be in charge of the facts,Premise
a president is called the commander in chief,Premise
you must understand the region,Premise
you must understand the politics in the area,Premise
you must provide a strong alternative,Premise
you must show strength,Premise
the leadership of this government did not pursue wise policies,Claim
we have been humiliated,Claim
our opponents are stronger,Claim
in the last few months it has seemed more and more that your policies in central america were beginning to work,Claim
just at this moment we are confronted with the extraordinary story of a cia guerrilla manual for the antisandinista contras whom we are backing,Premise
no,Claim
i know its on many peoples minds,Claim
i have ordered an investigation,Premise
i know that the cia is already going forward with one,Premise
we have a gentleman down in nicaragua who is on contract to the cia advising  supposedly on military tactics  the contras,Premise
well take the proper action at the proper time,Claim
i thought for a moment that instead of a debate i was going to find mr mondale in complete agreement with what were doing,Claim
were not in the habit of assigning guilt before there has been proper evidence produced and proof of that guilt,Premise
whoever is guilty we will treat with that situation then,Claim
i misspoke when i said a cia head in nicaragua,Premise
theres not someone there directing all of this activity,Premise
it was a man down there in that area that this was delivered to and he recognized that what was in that manual was in direct contravention of my own executive order in december of 1981,Premise
this manual  several thousands of which were produced  was distributed ordering political assassinations hiring of criminals and other forms of terrorism,Premise
some of it was excised but the part dealing with political terrorism was continued,Premise
what about the mining of the harbors in nicaragua which violated international law,Premise
this has hurt this country,Claim
i never ever conceived of such a thing,Claim
i never said any such thing,Claim
in a discussion of our strategic arms negotiations i said that submarines carrying missiles and airplanes carrying missiles were more conventionaltype weapons not as destabilizing as the landbased missiles,Premise
if they want to keep their mickey mouse system thats okay with me,Claim
i also recognize that as the two great superpowers in the world we have to live with each other,Claim
i told mr gromyko we dont like their system,Premise
between us we can either destroy the world or we can save it,Claim
i think that perhaps we established a little better understanding,Claim
i think that in dealing with the soviet union one has to be realistic,Claim
i know that mr mondale in the past has made statements as if they were just people like ourselves,Premise
we canceled the b  1 under the previous administration,Premise
the soviet union has been engaged in the biggest military buildup in the history of man at the same time that we tried the policy of unilateral disarmament of weakness if you will,Premise
now we are putting up a defense of our own,Premise
theres been no change in my attitude at all,Claim
were not going to change their system,Claim
we seek no superiority,Claim
we simply are going to provide a deterrent so that it will be too costly for them if they are nursing any ideas of aggression against us,Premise
were not,Claim
one is the middle east,Claim
because of the great supply of energy upon which so many depend there,Premise
our neighbors here in america are vital to us,Claim
were working right now in trying to be of help in southern africa with regard to the independence of namibia and the removal of the cuban surrogates the thousands of them from angola,Premise
there are a number of areas in the world that are of importance to us,Claim
i can say there are a great many interests,Claim
i believe that we have a great interest in the pacific basin,Claim
that is where i think the future of the world lies,Claim
we must as past presidents before this one have done meet on the common ground of survival,Claim
thats where the president has opposed practically every arms control agreement by every president of both political parties since the bomb went off,Premise
the only type of agreements to reach with the soviet union are the types that are specifically defined,Claim
so we know exactly what they must do,Premise
we know every day whether theyre living up to it,Premise
followups wherever we find suggestions that theyre violating it,Premise
the strongest possible terms,Premise
i have no illusions about the soviet union leadership or the nature of that state,Premise
they are a tough and a ruthless adversary,Claim
we must be prepared to meet that challenge,Claim
he now completes this term with no progress toward arms control at all but with a very dangerous arms race underway instead,Claim
there are now over 2000 more warheads pointed at us today than there were when he was sworn in,Premise
we must be very very realistic in the nature of that leadership,Premise
we must grind away and talk to find ways of reducing these differences particularly where arms races are concerned and other dangerous exercises of soviet power,Premise
there will be no unilateral disarmament under my administration,Claim
i will keep this nation strong,Claim
i understand exactly what the soviets are up to,Claim
thats where the presidents failure to master in my opinion the essential elements of arms control has cost us dearly,Claim
i will issue the statement quoting president reagan  he said exactly what i said he said,Premise
i think the essential strategy of the united states ought not accept any soviet control over eastern europe,Claim
we ought to deal with each of these countries separately,Claim
we ought to pursue strategies with each of them economic and the rest that help them pull away from their dependence upon the soviet union,Claim
i believe we ought to insist that western credits extended to the soviet union bear the market rate,Claim
thats an image of strength,Premise
he was against the f  14 fighter,Premise
he was against the m  1 tank,Premise
he was against the b  1 bomber,Premise
he wanted to cut the salary of all of the military,Premise
he wanted to bring home half of the american forces in europe,Premise
he has a record of weakness with regard to our national defense that is second to none,Claim
he was on that side virtually throughout all his years in the senate,Premise
he opposed even president carter when toward the end of his term president carter wanted to increase the defense budget,Premise
i have proposed a budget which would increase our nations strength in real terms by double that of the soviet union,Claim
the plane wasnt flying the way it was supposed to be,Premise
it is true over 10 years ago i voted to delay production of the f  14,Claim
it was a waste of money,Premise
your definition of national strength is to throw money at the defense department,Claim
my definition of national strength is to make certain that a dollar spent buys us a dollars worth of defense,Claim
i will keep us strong,Claim
youll not do that unless you command that budget and make certain we get the strength that we need,Claim
you pay 500 for a 5 hammer youre not buying strength,Premise
american interests should be sharply defined publicly supported congressionally sanctioned militarily feasible internationally defensible open to independent scrutiny and alert to regional history,Claim
no,Claim
i believe every one of those standards is essential to the exercise of power by this country,Claim
in lebanon this president exercised american power all right but the management of it was such that our marines were killed,Premise
we had to leave in humiliation,Premise
the soviet union became stronger,Premise
terrorists became emboldened,Premise
our enemies are strengthened from all of this,Claim
we need to be strong,Claim
we need to be prepared to use that strength,Claim
we must understand that we are a democracy,Claim
we are a government by the people,Premise
it is only in that way that we can persevere,Claim
the nicaraguans must know that it is the policy of our government that that leadership must stay behind the boundaries of their nation not interfere in other nations,Claim
what im referring to there is the mutual selfdefense provisions that exist in the interamerican treaty the socalled rio pact that permits the nations our friends in that region to combine to take steps  diplomatic and otherwise  to prevent nicaragua when she acts irresponsibly in asserting power in other parts outside of her border to take those steps whatever they might be to stop it,Premise
i dont agree to all of those things,Claim
when we and our allies  the italians the french and the united kingdom  went into lebanon we went in there at the request of what was left of the lebanese government to be a stabilizing force while they tried to establish a government,Premise
the first time we went in we went in at their request because the war was going on right in beirut between israel and the plo terrorists,Premise
those terrorists had been violating their northern border consistently and israel chased them all the way to there,Premise
then we went in with the multinational force to help remove and did remove more than 13000 of those terrorists from lebanon,Premise
then the government of lebanon asked us back in as a stabilizing force while they established a government and sought to get the foreign forces all the way out of lebanon and that they could then take care of their own borders,Premise
we were there for the better part of a year,Premise
i will never send troops anywhere on a mission of that kind without telling them that if somebody shoots at them they can darn well shoot back,Claim
we never initiated any kind of action,Claim
we defended ourselves there,Claim
we were succeeding to the point that the lebanese government had been organized,Premise
there were the meetings in geneva in which they began to meet with the hostile factional forces and try to put together some kind of a peace plan,Premise
that was why the terrorist acts began,Claim
there are forces there  and that includes syria in my mind  who dont want us to succeed,Claim
the terrorist acts began and led to the one great tragedy when they were killed in that suicide bombing of the building,Premise
we withdrew because we were no longer able to carry out the mission for which we had been sent in,Claim
we went in in the interest of peace and to keep israel and syria from getting into the sixth war between them,Claim
no,Claim
i think theres a great difference between the government of iran threatening our diplomatic personnel and there is a government that you can see and can put your hand on,Claim
in the terrorist situation there are terrorist factions all over,Premise
its going to take all the nations together,Claim
just as when we banded together we pretty much resolved the whole problem of skyjackings sometime ago,Premise
in a recent 30day period 37 terrorist acts in 20 countries have been committed,Premise
the most recent has been the one in brighton,Premise
i have just signed legislation to add to our ability to deal along with our allies with this terrorist problem,Premise
the united states left in humiliation,Claim
our enemies are stronger,Claim
the joint chiefs urged the president not to put our troops in that barracks,Claim
the report following the explosion of the barracks disclosed that we had not taken any of the steps that we should have taken,Premise
we were warned 5 days before that explosives were on their way and they werent taken,Premise
the embassy was blown up a few weeks ag,Premise
the terrorists have won each time,Premise
the president told the terrorists he was going to retaliate,Premise
he didnt,Premise
they called their bluff,Premise
the president of the united states did not order the marines into that barracks,Claim
they went to him 5 days before they were killed and said please take them out of there,Premise
he did not do so,Claim
that was a command decision made by the commanders on the spot and based with what they thought was best for the men there,Premise
retaliation will be taken,Claim
were not going to simply kill some people to say oh look we got even,Claim
we want to know when we retaliate that were retaliating with those who are responsible for the terrorist acts,Premise
terrorist acts are such that our own united states capitol in washington has been bombed twice,Premise
not at all,Claim
i will not make age an issue of this campaign,Claim
i am not going to exploit for political purposes my opponents youth and inexperience,Claim
no,Claim
i have not made it an issue nor should it be,Claim
whats at issue here is the presidents application of his authority to understand what a president must know to lead this nation,Claim
this is the first administration since the bomb went off that made no progress,Claim
we have an arms race underway instead,Premise
we just heard the presidents answer for the problems at the barracks in lebanon where 241 marines were killed,Premise
the joint chiefs of staff went to the president said dont put those troops there,Premise
then 5 days before the troops were killed they went back to the president through the secretary of defense and said please mr president take those troops out of there because we cant defend them,Premise
after that once again our embassy was exploded,Premise
this is the fourth time this has happened  an identical attack in the same region despite warnings  even public warnings  from the terrorists,Premise
for 312 years this administration avoided arms control,Premise
resisted tabling arms control proposals that had any hope of agreeing,Premise
rebuked their negotiator in 1981 when he came close to an agreement at least in principle on mediumrange weapons,Premise
and we have this arms race underway,Premise
and a recent book that just came out by perhaps the nations most respected author in this field strobe talbott called deadly gambits concludes that this president has failed to master the essential details needed to command and lead us both in terms of security and terms of arms control,Premise
you must be tough and smart,Claim
it takes more than that,Claim
che guevara was a contemptible figure in civilizations history,Claim
i know the cuban state as a police state,Premise
you have not repudiated some of the semidiplomatic activity of the reverend jackson,Claim
jesse jackson is an independent person,Premise
i dont control him,Premise
i am in charge,Claim
we havent avoided arms control talks with the soviet union,Claim
very early in my administration i proposed  and i think something that had never been proposed by any previous administration  i proposed a total elimination of intermediaterange missiles where the soviets had better than a 10  and still have  better than a 10to1 advantage over the allies in europe,Premise
when they protested that and suggested a smaller number perhaps i went along with that,Premise
the socalled negotiation that you said i walked out on was the socalled walk in the woods between one of our representatives and one of the soviet union,Premise
there are two distinguished authors on arms control in this country,Claim
one is strobe talbott in his classic book deadly gambits,Premise
the other is john neuhaus whos one of the most distinguished arms control specialists in our country,Premise
when mr nitze a good negotiator returned he was rebuked and his boss was fired,Premise
this is the kind of leadership that weve had in this administration on the most deadly issue of our times,Claim
all theyve got to show for 4 years in ussoviet relations is one meeting in the last weeks of an administration and nothing before,Premise
this one has not,Claim
our number one foreign policy problem today is one that remains almost totally unrecognized massive illegal immigration from economically collapsing countries,Claim
it is the only real territorial threat to the american nationstate,Claim
it has to be dealt with,Claim
i object to that part of the simpsonmazzoli bill which i think is very unfair and would prove to be so that is the part that requires employers to determine the citizenship of an employee before theyre hired,Claim
im convinced that the result of this would be that people who are hispanic people who have different languages or speak with an accent would find it difficult to be employed,Premise
i think thats wrong,Claim
weve never had citizenship tests in our country before,Premise
that is counterproductive,Claim
i do support the other aspects of the simpsonmazzoli bill that strengthen enforcement at the border,Premise
i have further strongly recommended that this administration do something it has not done,Premise
strengthen enforcement at the border,Premise
strengthen the officials in this government that deal with undocumented workers,Premise
do so in a way thats responsible and within the constitution of the united states,Premise
we need an answer to this problem,Claim
everyone in this room practically here tonight is an immigrant,Premise
we came here loving this nation serving it and it has served all of our most bountiful dreams,Premise
and one of those dreams is justice,Premise
we cannot solve this problem all on our own,Claim
maintain and improve relations with our friends to the south,Premise
there will be no immigration reform without employer sanctions,Claim
it would be an unbalanced bill,Premise
there would be simply no way to enforce it,Premise
you have not gone along with the bill or with any immigration reform,Claim
im not doing it for political reasons,Claim
the polls show that the majority of hispanics want that bill,Premise
im doing it,Claim
this bill imposes upon employers the responsibility of determining whether somebody who applies for a job is an american or not,Premise
and just inevitably theyre going to be reluctant to hire hispanics or people with a different accent,Premise
if i were dealing with politics here the polls show the american people want this,Premise
i am for reform in this area,Claim
despite the politics of it i stand where i stand,Premise
i think im right,Claim
before this fight is over were going to come up with a better bill a more effective bill that does not undermine the liberties of our people,Claim
our borders are out of control,Claim
this fall you allowed the simpsonmazzoli bill  which would at least have minimally protected our borders and the rights of citizenship  because of a relatively unimportant issue of reimbursement to the states for legalized aliens,Premise
we believe me supported the simpsonmazzoli bill strongly  and the bill that came out of the senate,Claim
there were things added in in the house side that we felt made it less of a good bill,Premise
made it a bad bill,Premise
and in conference  we stayed with them in conference all the way to where even senator simpson did not want the bill in the manner in which it would come out of the conference committee,Premise
there were a number of things in there that weakened that bill,Claim
our borders are out of control,Claim
it is also true that this has been a situation on our borders back through a number of administrations,Premise
we dont think that those people should be allowed to continue operating free,Claim
i believe in the idea of amnesty for those who have put down roots and who have lived here even though sometime back they may have entered illegally,Premise
with regard to the employer sanctions we must have that not only to ensure that we can identify the illegal aliens,Premise
there is another employer that we shouldnt be so concerned about and these are employers down through the years who have encouraged the illegal entry into this country because they then hire these individuals and hire them at starvation wages and with none of the benefits that we think are normal and natural for workers in our country and the individuals cant complain because of their illegal status,Premise
im going to do everything i can and all of us in the administration are to join in again when congress is back at it to get an immigration bill that will give us once again control of our borders,Claim
as long as they have an economy that leaves so many people in dire poverty and unemployment they are going to seek that employment across our borders,Premise
we work with those other countries,Premise
the situation today is terribly different quantitatively  qualitatively different from what it has been in the past,Claim
no,Claim
the population explosion if you look at the actual figures has been vastly exaggerated  over exaggerated,Claim
there are some pretty scientific and solid figures about how much space there still is in the world and how many more people we can have,Premise
its almost like going back to the malthusian theory when even then they were saying that everyone would starve with the limited population they had then,Premise
the problem of population growth is one here with regard to our immigration,Claim
we have been the safety valve whether we wanted to or not with the illegal entry here in mexico where their population is increasing and they dont have an economy that can absorb them and provide the jobs,Premise
this is what were trying to work out not only to protect our own borders but to have some kind of fairness and recognition of that problem,Claim
one of the biggest problems today is that the countries to our south are so desperately poor that these people who will almost lose their lives if they dont come north come north despite all the risks,Claim
it goes to american economic and trade policies that permit these nations to have a chance to get on their own two feet and to get prosperity so that they can have jobs for themselves and their people,Premise
this enormous national debt engineered by this administration is harming these countries in fueling this immigration,Claim
these high interest rates  real rates that have doubled under this administration  have had the same effect on mexico and so on,Premise
that drives our friends to the south up into our region,Claim
it has nothing to do with it,Claim
i predict itll be coming down a little more shortly,Claim
with regard to these high interest rates too at least give us the recognition of the fact that when you left office mr mondale they were 2112  the prime rate its now 1214,Premise
were trying to undo some of the things that your administration did,Claim
you do believe deep down that we are heading for some kind of biblical armageddon,Claim
your pentagon and your secretary of defense have plans for the united states to fight and prevail in a nuclear war,Premise
i think what has been hailed as something im supposedly as president discussing as principle is the recall of just some philosophical discussions with people who are interested in the same things,Premise
that is the prophecies down through the years the biblical prophecies of what would portend the coming of armageddon and so forth,Premise
the fact that a number of theologians for the last decade or more have believed that this was true that the prophecies are coming together that portend that,Premise
no one knows whether armageddon those prophecies mean that armageddon is a thousand years away or day after tomorrow,Premise
i have never seriously warned and said we must plan according to armageddon,Claim
of course we would,Claim
a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought,Claim
that is why we are maintaining a deterrent and trying to achieve a deterrent capacity to where no one would believe that they could start such a war and escape with limited damage,Premise
the deterrent  and thats what it is for  is also what led me to propose what is now being called the star wars concept,Premise
there has never been a weapon invented in the history of man that has not led to a defensive a counterweapon,Premise
why not do what i have offered to do and asked the soviet union to do say look heres what we can do well even give it to you now will you sit down with us and once and for all get rid all of us of these nuclear weapons and free mankind from that threat,Premise
i think that would be the greatest use of a defensive weapon,Claim
let me sharply disagree with the president on sharing the most advanced the most dangerous the most important technology in america with the soviet union,Premise
we have had for many years understandably a system of restraints on high technology because the soviets are behind us,Premise
any research or development along the star wars schemes would inevitably involve our most advanced computers our most advanced engineering,Premise
i would not let the soviet union get their hands on it at all,Claim
theres nothing wrong with the theory of it,Claim
if we could develop a principle that would say both sides could fire all their missiles and no one would get hurt i suppose its a good idea,Premise
the fact of it is were so far away from research that even comes close to that that the director of engineering research at the defense department said to get there we would have to solve eight problems each of which are more difficult than the atomic bomb and the manhattan project,Premise
it would cost something like a trillion dollars to test and deploy weapons,Claim
the second thing is this all assumes that the soviets wouldnt respond in kind,Premise
they always do,Claim
we dont get behind,Premise
they wont get behind,Premise
we have more at stake in space satellites than they do,Claim
to commit this nation to a buildup of antisatellite and space weapons at this time in their crude state would bring about an arms race thats very dangerous indeed,Premise
the most dangerous aspect of this proposal is for the first time we would delegate to computers the decision as to whether to start a war,Claim
thats dead wrong,Claim
there wouldnt be time for a president to decide,Premise
it would be decided by these remote computers,Premise
it might be an oil fire it might be a jet exhaust the computer might decide its a missile  and off we go,Premise
the basis of your arms proposals as i understand them is a mutual and verifiable freeze on existing weapons systems,Premise
every system that is verifiable should be placed on the table for negotiations for an agreement,Claim
i would not agree to any negotiations or any agreement that involved conduct on the part of the soviet union that we couldnt verify every day,Premise
i would not agree to any agreement in which the united states security interest was not fully recognized and supported,Premise
this everrising arms race madness makes both nations less secure,Claim
its more difficult to defend this nation,Claim
its putting a hairtrigger on nuclear war,Claim
this administration by going into the star wars system is going to add a dangerous new escalation,Premise
i think the american people and the people of the soviet union want it to stop,Claim
this invention that has just been created here of how i would go about rolling over for the soviet union  no mr mondale my idea would be with that defensive weapon that we would sit down with them and then say now are you willing to join us heres what we  give them a demonstration and then say  heres what we can do now if youre willing to join us in getting rid of all the nuclear weapons in the world then well give you this one so that we would both know that no one can cheat that were both got something that if anyone tries to cheat    ,Premise
i never suggested where the weapons should be or what kind,Claim
im not a scientist,Premise
i said and the joint chiefs of staff agreed with me that it was time for us to turn our research ability to seeing if we could not find this kind of defensive weapon,Premise
and suddenly somebody says oh its got to be up there and its star wars and so forth,Premise
i dont know what it would be but if we can come up with one i think the world will be better off,Claim
thats what a presidents supposed to know  where those weapons are going to be,Claim
this is the most dangerous technology that we possess,Claim
the soviets try to spy on us steal this stuff,Premise
and to give them technology of this kind i disagree with,Premise
you havent just accepted research mr president,Claim
this is an arms escalation,Claim
we will be better off far better off if we stop right now,Claim
we have more to lose in space then they do,Premise
if someday somebody comes along with an answer thats something else,Premise
that there would be an answer in our lifetime is unimaginable,Premise
thats what a presidents for,Claim
we have a vast range of technology and weaponry right now that provides all the bargaining chips that we need,Claim
i support the air launch cruise missile the ground launch cruise missile the pershing missile the trident submarine the d  5 submarine stealth technology the midgetman  we have a whole range of technology,Premise
its a sitting duck,Claim
itll draw an attack,Claim
it puts a hairtrigger and it is a dangerous destabilizing weapon,Claim
the b  1 is similarly to be opposed,Claim
for 15 years the soviet union has been preparing to meet the b  1,Premise
the secretary of defense himself said it would be a suicide mission if it were built,Premise
i want to build the midgetman,Claim
this makes us stronger,Claim
we can use this money that we save on these weapons to spend on things that we really need,Claim
our conventional strength in europe is under strength,Premise
every president until this one has been able to do it,Premise
this nation  or the world is more dangerous as a result,Claim
you do have some problems with the extent of the freeze,Claim
research would be impossible to verify,Claim
numbers of warheads would be impossible to verify by satellite except for with onsite inspection,Claim
testing would be very difficult to verify,Claim
the soviets encode their telemetry,Premise
i will not agree to any arms control agreement including a freeze thats not verifiable,Claim
the warhead principle  there have been counting rules for years,Premise
whenever a weapon is tested we count the number of warheads on it and whenever that warhead is used we count that number of warheads whether they have that number or less on it or not,Premise
i will not agree to any production restrictions  or agreements unless we have the ability to verify those agreements,Claim
i dont trust the russians,Claim
weve got to be tough,Claim
in order to stop this arms madness weve got to push ahead with tough negotiations that are verifiable,Claim
because of our undercutting of what was a stalwart ally  the shah of iran,Premise
i am not at all convinced that he was that far out of line with his people or that they wanted that to happen,Premise
the shah had done our bidding and carried our load in the middle east for quite some time,Premise
the shah whatever he might have done was building lowcost housing had taken land away from the mullahs and was distributing it to the peasants so they could be landowners  things of that kind,Premise
we turned it over to a maniacal fanatic who has slaughtered thousands and thousands of people calling it executions,Claim
i never defended somoza,Claim
the previous administration stood by and so did i  not that i could have done anything in my position at that time  but for this revolution to take place,Premise
the promise of the revolution was democracy human rights free labor unions free press,Premise
just as castro had done in cuba the sandinistas ousted the other parties to the revolution,Premise
many of them are now the contras,Premise
they exiled some they jailed some they murdered some,Premise
they installed a marxistleninist totalitarian government,Premise
i know there are things there in the philippines that do not look good to us from the standpoint right now of democratic rights but what is the alternative,Premise
it is a large communist movement to take over the philippines,Premise
they have been our friend since their inception as a nation,Premise
i think that weve had enough of a record of letting  under the guise of revolution  someone that we thought was a little more right than we would be letting that person go and then winding up with totalitarianism pure and simple as the alternative,Claim
i think that were better off for example with the philippines of trying to retain our friendship and help them right the wrongs we see rather than throwing them to the wolves and then facing a communist power in the pacific,Claim
we have to look at what an overthrow there would mean and what the government would be that would follow,Premise
there is every evidence every indication that that government would be hostile to the united states,Premise
that would be a severe blow to our abilities there in the pacific,Claim
in no area do we disagree more than this administrations policies on human rights,Claim
i went to the philippines as vice president,Premise
what happens in south africa where for example the nobel prize winner 2 days ago said this administration is seen as working with the oppressive government of south africa,Premise
that hurts this nation,Claim
we need to stand for human rights,Claim
we need to make it clear were for human liberty,Claim
national security and human rights must go together,Claim
this administration time and time again has lost its way in this field,Claim
the invasion of afghanistan didnt take place on our watch,Premise
i have described what has happened in iran and we werent here then either,Premise
i dont think that our record of human rights can be assailed,Claim
i think that we have observed ourselves and have done our best to see that human rights are extended throughout the world,Claim
mr mondale has recently announced a plan of his to get the democracies together and to work with the whole world to turn to democracy,Premise
human rights are not advanced when at the same time you then stand back and say whoops we didnt know the gun was loaded and you have another totalitarian power on your hands,Claim
you might be trying to gain the sort of advantage that would enable you to dictate terms,Claim
as soon as we have an investigation and find out where any blame lies for the few that did not get excised or changed we certainly are going to do something about that,Claim
the cia in nicaragua is directing the contras there,Claim
a president must know these things,Claim
a presidents supposed to command,Premise
that particular thing which is absolutely false,Claim
how anyone could think that any sane person would believe you could call back a nuclear missile i think is as ridiculous as the whole concept has been,Premise
i believe that many of the things they have done are evil in any concept of morality that we have,Claim
hes 3 years into this administration,Premise
he said he just discovered that most soviet missiles are on land and thats why his proposal didnt work,Premise
theres a big difference between the two of us,Claim
a president must manage that budget,Premise
we can see that in both lebanon and in central america,Premise
you might quarantine nicaragua,Claim
you were unaware that the soviet retaliatory power was based on landbased missiles,Claim
the whole controversy about land missiles came up because we thought that the strategic nuclear weapons the most destabilizing are the landbased,Premise
you put your thumb on a button and somebody blows up 20 minutes later,Premise
we thought that it would be simpler to negotiate first with those,Premise
then we made it plain a second phase take up the submarinelaunched or the airborne missiles,Premise
the soviet union to our surprise  and not just mine  made it plain when we brought this up that they placed they thought a greater reliance on the landbased missiles and therefore they wanted to take up all three,Premise
we need a measure  and i will support a measure  that brings about those objectives but avoids that one aspect that i think is very serious,Claim
thats why the failure of this administration to deal in an effective and a goodfaith way with mexico with costa rica with the other nations in trying to find a peaceful settlement to the dispute in central america has undermined our capacity to effectively deal diplomatically in this area as well,Premise
mexicos population will go from about 60 million today to 120 million at the turn of the century,Premise
many of these people will be coming into the united states not as citizens but as illegal workers,Premise
i believe that every agreement we reach must be verifiable,Claim
i will not agree to anything that we cannot tell every day,Claim
this nation was embarrassed by this current administrations adoption of their policies,Claim
if the development of space military technology was successful you might give the soviets a demonstration and say here it is,Claim
i have said that it seems to me that this could be a logical step in what is my ultimate goal my ultimate dream and that is the elimination of nuclear weapons in the world,Premise
it seems to me that this could be an adjunct or certainly a great assisting agent in getting that done,Premise
i am not going to roll over as mr mondale suggests and give them something that could turn around and be used against us,Claim
i think its a very interesting proposal to see if we can find first of all something that renders those weapons obsolete incapable of their mission,Claim
mr mondale seems to approve mad,Premise
i think that to do everything we can to find as i say something that would destroy weapons and not humans is a great step forward in human rights,Claim
i believe in a sensible arms control approach that brings down these weapons to manageable levels,Claim
we have to be strong enough to make certain that the soviet union never tempts us,Claim
here we have to decide between generalized objectives and reality,Premise
the president says he wants to eliminate or reduce the number of nuclear weapons,Claim
in fact these last 4 years have seen more weapons built a wider and more vigorous arms race than in human history,Premise
a president to defend this country and to get arms control must master whats going on,Claim
we must know what were doing and pursue those objectives that are possible in our time,Claim
hes opposed every effort of every president to do so,Premise
i believe we need to be strong,Claim
i think strength must also require wisdom and smarts in its exercise,Claim
thats key to the strength of our nation,Claim
a president must also have a vision of where this nation should go,Premise
as president i would press for longterm vigorous economic growth,Claim
i want to get these debts down and these interest rates down,Premise
restore americas exports,Premise
help rural america,Premise
bring the jobs back here for our children,Premise
i want this next generation to be the best educated in american history,Premise
i want this nation to protect its air its water its land and its public health,Premise
as americans our generation should protect this wonderful land for our children,Claim
america is not temporary were forever,Premise
i want a nation of fairness where no one is denied the fullness of life or discriminated against and we deal compassionately with those in our midst who are in trouble,Premise
i want a nation thats strong,Premise
since we debated 2 weeks ago the united states and the soviet union have built a hundred more warheads enough to kill millions of americans and millions of soviet citizens,Premise
this doesnt strengthen us,Claim
this weakens the chances of civilization to survive,Claim
pick a president that you know will know if that tragic moment ever comes what he must know,Claim
therell be no time for staffing committees or advisers,Premise
a president must know right then,Premise
pick a president who will fight to avoid the day when that godawful decision ever needs to be made,Claim
we are the strongest and most powerful free society on earth,Premise
when you make that judgment you are deciding not only the future of our nation in a very profound respect youre deciding the future of the world,Premise
we need to move on,Claim
its time for america to find new leadership,Claim
i think the american people tonight have much to be grateful for,Claim
we shouldnt be dwelling on the past or even the present,Claim
the meaning of this election is the future and whether were going to grow and provide the jobs and the opportunities for all americans and that they need,Premise
i seek reelection,Claim
i am grateful to all of you for giving me the opportunity to serve you for these 4 years,Premise

i recall yet that president kennedy had to go for days on end with very little sleep during the cuban missile crisis,Premise
you yourself said in the 1970s that we had a hemorrhage on our borders,Premise
you would share this very supersophisticated technology with the soviet union,Claim

strengthened our opposition,Premise
undermined the moral authority of our country in that region,Premise
which advocates not only assassinations of sandinistas but the hiring of criminals to assassinate the guerrillas we are supporting in order to create martyrs,Premise
he drew up this manual,Premise
it was turned over to the agency head of the cia in nicaragua to be printed,Premise
a number of pages were excised by that agency head there the man in charge and he sent it on up here to cia where more pages were excised before it was printed,Premise
but some way or other there were 12 of the original copies that got out down there and were not submitted for this printing process by the cia,Premise
the plan that he has outlined is the one weve been following for quite some time including diplomatic processes throughout central america and working closely with the contadora group,Premise
if guilt is established,Premise
they will be removed,Claim
there are as you know cia men stationed in other countries in the world and certainly in central america,Premise
a president cant know everything,Premise
a president has to know those things that are essential to his leadership and the enforcement of our laws,Claim
they were also weapons that  or carriers  that if they were sent out and there was a change you could call them back before they had launched their missiles,Premise
i have said on a number of occasions exactly what i believe about the soviet union,Premise
if we were kind and good and did something nice they would respond accordingly,Claim
the result was unilateral disarmament,Premise
what did we get for it nothing,Premise
that is of interest to the whole western world and the industrialized nations,Claim
i dont want to send troops any place,Claim
i would,Claim
that does not strengthen us,Premise
a president must know what is essential to command and to leadership and to strength,Premise
these missiles were less dangerous than ballistic missiles,Claim
you could fire them and you could recall them if you decided thered been a miscalculation,Premise
make the soviets pay for their irresponsibility,Premise
we ended up the way we did,Claim
they did not think through how power should be exercised,Premise
did not have the american public with them on a plan that worked,Premise
what were doing in nicaragua with this covert war  which the congress including many republicans have tried to stop  is finally end up with a public definition of american power that hurts us,Premise
we get associated with political assassins and the rest,Premise
we have to decline for the first time in modern history jurisdiction in the world court,Claim
theyll find us guilty of illegal actions,Premise

make the decisions and the judgments that are necessary,Claim
they did it,Premise
they didnt do it,Premise
all my life ive worked in a way that demonstrates that,Premise
it wasnt me that turned it down the soviet union disavowed it,Premise

we need to end those deficits as well,Claim

the lifeblood of our economy is investment,Claim
right now when we pay 350  we borrow 350 billion a year it saps the money markets and the private investors are not getting their share,Premise

according to the statistics coming from the bushquayle labor dept for the last 2 years in a role bill clintons state has been number one among all 50 in the creation of jobs in the private sector,Premise
by contrast in the nation as a whole during the last 4 years it is the first time since the presidency of herbert hoover that we have gone for a 4year period with fewer jobs at the end of that 4year period than we had at the beginning,Premise
look at manufacturing,Premise
we have lost 14 million jobs in manufacturing under george bush and dan quayle,Premise

the program is out there,Premise
its a puttogether thing that requires some sacrifice but not excessive,Premise
it could throw our nation back into an even worse recession,Claim
the difference between the perot stockdale plan and the clintongore plan is that ross perots plan concentrates almost exclusively on balancing the budget and reducing the budget deficit,Premise
bill clinton and i have a detailed 5year budget plan to create good jobs,Premise
we have a 20billion infrastructure fund to create a nationwide network of highspeed rail for example and what are called information superhighways to open up a whole universe of knowledge for our young people and to help our universities and companies that rely on new advances in the information revolution,Premise
we also have tax incentives for investment in jobcreating activities,Premise
not the kind of encouragement for shortterm ripoffs like the proposal that we have had from george bush,Premise

thats not right,Claim
we have product liability reform legislation on capitol hill,Premise
it will create jobs,Claim
a democratic congress wont pass it,Claim

there are going to be major cuts,Claim
theyve already started in the defense budget,Premise
bill clinton and i support a strong national defense,Claim
he and i have both fought for change within the democratic party as well as within the country,Premise
in the aftermath of the cold war the definition of strong national defense has obviously changed somewhat,Premise
we believe that we can make savings in our defense budget and at the same time improve our national security,Claim
it is time for the europeans who are so much wealthier now and more powerful than they were at the end of world war ii to start picking up a little more of that tab themselves and not rely so exclusively on the us taxpayers for the defense of europe,Claim
george bush wants to maintain at least 150000 american soldiers in europe even though world war ii ended 50 years ago,Premise
for those who are affected by the cutbacks whether they come from george bush or bill clinton and me  the difference is bill clinton and i have a defense conversion program so that those who won the cold war will not be left out in the cold,Premise

we would not have won the cold war,Claim
we would not have won the cold war,Claim
we won the cold war,Claim
i think that should be eyed with great suspicion people that are really kicking the props out from under our grand military establishment prematurely,Claim
the numbers in terms of the dollar cuts as they stand on our plans now show us almost the same as the vice presidents,Premise
but wed note that mr  governor clintons plan is almost twice as much a cut as either one of us,Premise
ive been through the end of world war ii and the surprise beginning of korea,Premise
theres other differences between the perot approach and what we see up here on either side of me,Claim
we want to focus our interests economic and military more to the pacific,Premise
we figure that we are generally going along with any sort of a troop removal from europe,Premise
under the details of our 5year budget plan we do propose more in defense cuts than george bush and dan quayle,Claim
admiral crowe who i think was one of your classmates in annapolis has endorsed the military portions of our plan even though he was the chairman of the joint chiefs under george bush,Premise
when i heard george bush say at the convention in houston that when he heard the phrase we won the cold war it made him wonder who the we was,Premise
the we is the people of the us of america,Claim
this wasnt a partisan victory that came suddenly a few months after you took the oath of office,Claim
this started with harry truman and it was a bipartisan effort from the very beginning,Claim
george bush taking credit for the berlin wall coming down is like the rooster taking credit for the sunrise,Premise
it was kind of a little lecture he gave to ross perot when he said those ss18s are gone ross thats done,Premise
he reached a deal with boris yeltsin to completely remove them so we can all sleep safely without any fear tonight,Premise
in fact there are serious problems,Premise
isnt it a fact dan that every single one of those ss18s is still there in the silos and under the start i treaty only half of the silos are supposed to be dismantled and there is no deal to get rid of the other half,Premise
now there is no start ii deal at all,Claim
they thought they were going to get that deal but when he took the person in charge of the negotiations out of the state dept and put him in charge of the reelection campaign the deal unraveled,Premise
the president does have a commitment from boris yeltsin to eliminate the ss18s,Claim
it is a commitment,Claim
this is a fundamental problem with bill clinton is trust and character,Claim
the president of the us doesnt just negotiate with your friends in congress,Claim
the president of the us deals on the international scene,Claim
hes got to deal with the president of russia,Premise
and the leaders sit down and they will negotiate and they will come to agreements with people that they trust,Premise
he does not tell the truth about it,Claim
it is not the issue of how he avoided military service 20some years ago,Premise
he first said he didnt get an induction notice then we find out that he did,Premise
he said he didnt have an rotc slot then we find out he did,Premise
he said he didnt use senator fulbrights office for special influence then we find out that he did,Premise

bill clinton and i support the right of a woman to choose,Claim
that doesnt mean were proabortion,Premise
we believe there are way too many abortions in this country,Claim
the way to reduce them is by reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies,Claim
we believe that during the early stages of a pregnancy the government has no business coming in and ordering a woman to do what the government thinks is best,Claim
what dan quayle and george bush and jerry falwell and pat robertson think is the right decision in a given set of circumstances is their privilege,Premise

even in cases of rape and incest their platform requires that a woman be penalized that she not be allowed to make a choice if she believes in consultation with her family her doctor and others whoever she chooses that she wants to have an abortion after rape or incest,Claim
now you want to waffle around on it and give the impression that maybe you dont really mean what you say,Premise

thats not true,Claim
your top priority really isnt it to make sure that the very wealthy dont have to pay any more taxes,Claim
we want to cut taxes on middleincome families and raise them on those making more than 200000 a year,Premise
the cities will be much better off,Claim
everyone knows that you simply cant get 150 billion in new taxes by raising the marginal tax rate to a top rate of 36  and only tax those making 200000 a year,Premise
its absolutely ridiculous,Claim
the top 2  which you refer to that gets you down to 64000,Premise
then you have about a 40billion shortfall  that gets you down to 36000 a year,Premise
everybody making more than 36000 a year will have their taxes increased if bill clinton is president of the us,Claim

the enterprise zones represent a part of our proposal also and strengthening the family through welfare reform,Claim
the bush administration has cut out  has vetoed family leave they have cut childhood immunization and college aid,Premise

in my health care bill i said insurance companies need to provide contraceptive coverage to everybody who is insured,Claim

its an economic issue for women,Claim
a major difference in this campaign is that governor romney feels comfortable having politicians in washington decide the health care choices that women are making,Premise

i think thats a mistake,Claim
we were losing 800000 jobs a month when i started,Premise
we had been digging our way out of policies that were misplaced and focused on the top doing very well and middle class folks not doing well,Premise
weve seen 30 consecutive  31 consecutive months of job growth,Claim
the plans that i talked about will create even more,Claim

thats not what i do as commander in chief,Premise
i want to make sure we get that for the record,Claim
it took the president 14 days before he called the attack in benghazi an act of terror,Premise
it did as well take two weeks or so for the whole idea there being a riot out there about this tape to come out,Premise
you are correct about that,Claim
the administration indicated this was a reaction to a video and was a spontaneous reaction,Claim
it took them a long time to say this was a terrorist act by a terrorist group,Claim

im trying to do is to get a broader conversation about how do we reduce the violence generally,Claim
part of it is seeing if we can get an assault weapons ban reintroduced,Claim
part of it is also looking at other sources of the violence,Claim
what can we do to intervene to make sure that young people have opportunity,Claim
that our schools are working,Claim
that if theres violence on the streets that working with faith groups and law enforcement we can catch it before it gets out of control,Claim
part of it is seeing if we can get automatic weapons that kill folks in amazing numbers out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill,Premise
part of it is also going deeper and seeing if we can get into these communities and making sure we catch violent impulses before they occur,Premise
im not in favor of new pieces of legislation on  on guns and taking guns away or making certain guns illegal,Claim
we of course dont want to have automatic weapons,Premise
thats already illegal in this country to have automatic weapons,Premise
i believe is we have to do as the president mentioned towards the end of his remarks there which is to make enormous efforts to enforce the gun laws that we have,Claim

they havent put a credible solution on the table,Claim
heres what were saying give younger people when they become medicare eligible guaranteed coverage options that you cant be denied including traditional medicare,Claim
choose your plan and then medicare subsidizes your premiums not as much for the wealthy people more coverage for middleincome people and total outofpocket coverage for the poor and the sick,Claim
we would rather have 50 million future seniors determine how their medicare is delivered to them instead of 15 bureaucrats deciding what if when where they get it,Claim
not one of them even has to have medical training,Premise
this board by the way its 15 people the presidents supposed to appoint them next year,Premise
they put this new obamacare board in charge of cutting medicare each and every year in ways that will lead to denied care for current seniors,Premise

governor romney knowing that said i would sign it were i there,Premise
who you believe the ama me a guy whos fought his whole life for this or somebody who would actually put in motion a plan that knowingly cut  added 6400 a year more to the cost of medicare,Premise
they got a new plan trust me its not going to cost you any more,Premise
with regard to social security we will not  we will not privatize it,Claim
follow your instincts on this one,Premise
their ideas are old,Claim
their ideas are bad,Claim
they eliminate the guarantee of medicare,Claim
if we had listened to romney governor romney and the congressman during the bush years imagine where all those seniors would be now if their money had been in the market,Premise
they got caught with their hands in the cookie jar turning medicare into a piggybank for obamacare,Claim
their own actuary from the administration came to congress and said one out of six hospitals and nursing homes are going to go out of business as a result of this,Premise
thats not what they said,Claim

its a plan i put together with a prominent democrat senator from oregon,Premise
that 6400 number it was misleading then its totally inaccurate now,Claim
were saying income adjusts inaudible these premium support payments by taking down the subsidies for wealthy people,Claim

if we dont fix this problem pretty soon then current seniors get cut,Claim
seniors are not denied,Claim
they are not denied,Claim

the voucher says mom when youre  when youre 65 go out there shop for the best insurance you can get youre out of medicare,Premise
nobodys proposing that,Claim
a voucher is you go to your mailbox get a check and buy something,Premise
thats not what mitt romneys proposing,Claim
what were saying is no changes for anybody 55 and above,Premise
then the kinds of changes were talking about for younger people like myself is dont increase the benefits for wealthy people as fast as everybody else,Premise
slowly raise the retirement age over time,Premise
it wouldnt get to the age of 70 until the year 2103 according to the actuaries,Premise
for younger people,Premise
what we said then and what ive always agreed is let younger americans have a voluntary choice of making their money work faster for them within the social security system,Premise
all the studies show that if we went with social security proposal made by mitt romney if youre 40  in your 40s now you will pay 2600 a year  you get 2600 a year less in social security,Premise
if youre in your 20s now you get 4700 inaudible less,Premise
the idea of changing and change being in this case to cut the benefits for people without taking other action you could do to make it work is absolutely the wrong way,Claim
that statistic was completely misleading,Claim

our entire premise of these tax reform plans is to grow the economy and create jobs,Claim
its a plan thats estimated to create 7 million jobs,Premise
we think that government taking 28 percent of a family and businesss income is enough,Claim
president obama thinks that the government ought to be able to take as much as 448 percent of a small businesss income,Claim
there arent enough rich people and small businesses to tax to pay for all their spending,Claim
if everybody who paid income taxes last year including successful small businesses doubled their income taxes this year wed still have a 300 billion deficit,Premise
if you taxed every person and successful business making over 250000 at 100 percent it would only run the government for 98 days,Premise

we raised about 12 trillion through income taxes,Premise
we forego about 11 trillion in loopholes and deductions,Premise
deny those loopholes and deductions to higherincome taxpayers so that more of their income is taxed which has a broader base of taxation so we can lower tax rates across the board,Claim
we want to work with congress  we want to work with the congress on how best to achieve this,Claim
what were saying is lower tax rates 20 percent start with the wealthy work with congress to do it,Claim

if in fact it blows up and the wrong people gain control its going to have impact on the entire region causing potentially regional wars,Premise
we are working hand and glove with the turks with the jordanians with the saudis and with all the people in the region attempting to identify the people who deserve the help so that when assad goes  and he will go  there will be a legitimate government that follows on not an al qaidasponsored government that follows on,Premise

we wouldnt refer to bashar assad as a reformer when hes killing his own civilians with his russianprovided weapons,Claim

that is underway,Premise
we are in the process now  and have been for months  in making sure that help humanitarian aid as well as other aid and training is getting to those forces that we believe the turks believe the jordanians believe the saudis believe are the free forces inside of syria,Premise
our allies were all on the same page nato as well as our arab allies in terms of trying to get a settlement,Premise
that was their idea,Claim
were the ones that said enough with regard to the reset not working the fact of the matter is that russia has a different interest in syria than we do and thats not in our interest,Claim
we and the world community will lose our credibility on this,Claim
hell probably continue slaughtering his people,Claim
hes a sponsor of terrorism,Premise
then iran keeps their greatest ally in the region,Premise
theyre right about that,Claim

we should not have called bashar assad a reformer,Claim
what we should have done earlier is work with those freedom fighters those dissidents in syria,Claim

its got to be in the strategic national interests of our country,Claim
putting american troops on the ground thats got to be within the national security interests of the american people,Claim
each situation will  will come up with its own set of circumstances,Premise
that means like embargoes and sanctions and overflights those are things that dont put american troops on the ground,Claim
if youre talking about putting american troops on the ground only in our national security interests,Claim
this debate is indeed historic,Claim
we have two catholic candidates first time on a stage such as this,Premise
i dont see how a person can separate their public life from their private life or from their faith,Claim
our faith informs us in everything we do,Premise
my faith informs me about how to take care of the vulnerable of how to make sure that people have a chance in life,Premise
its also because of reason and science,Claim
thats a factor of course,Premise
its not simply because of my catholic faith,Claim
i believe that life begins at conception,Claim
i think about 10 12 years ago my wife janna and i went to mercy hospital in janesville where i was born for our seven week ultrasound for our firstborn child and we saw that heartbeat,Premise
a little baby was in the shape of a bean,Premise
to this day we have nicknamed our firstborn child liza bean,Premise
those are the reasons why im prolife,Premise
the policy of a romney administration will be to oppose abortions with the exceptions for rape incest and life of the mother,Claim
i respect people who dont agree with me on this,Claim
i understand this is a difficult issue,Premise
that to me is pretty extreme,Claim
the vice president himself went to china and said that he sympathized and wouldnt second guess their one child policy of forced abortions and sterilizations,Premise
taxpayer funding in obamacare taxpayer funding with foreign aid,Premise
they support it without restriction and with taxpayer funding,Claim
with respect to abortion the democratic party used to say they wanted it to be safe legal and rare,Premise
our church should not have to sue our federal government to maintain their religious liberties,Claim
what troubles me more is how this administration has handled all of these issues,Premise
look at what theyre doing through obamacare with respect to assaulting the religious liberties of this country,Premise
theyre infringing upon our first freedom the freedom of religion by infringing on catholic charities catholic churches catholic hospitals,Claim
i do not believe that we have a right to tell other people that  women they cant control their body,Claim
its a decision between them and their doctor,Premise
in my view and the supreme court im not going to interfere with that,Claim
i refuse to impose it on equally devout christians and muslims and jews,Premise
i just refuse to impose that on others,Premise
unlike my friend here the  the congressman,Premise
i accept it in my personal life,Premise
life begins at conception in the churchs judgment,Premise
with regard to  with regard to abortion i accept my churchs position on abortion as a  what we call a inaudible doctrine,Premise
the catholic social doctrine talks about taking care of those who  who cant take care of themselves people who need help,Premise
and has particularly informed my social doctrine,Premise
ive been a practicing catholic my whole life,Premise
my religion defines who i am,Premise
i just fundamentally disagree with my friend,Claim
hes argued that in the case of rape or incest it was still  it would be a crime to engage in having an abortion,Premise
now with regard to the way in which the  we differ my friend says that he  well i guess he accepts governor romneys position now because in the past he has argued that there was  theres rape and forcible rape,Premise
that is a fact,Premise
that is a fact,Premise
with regard to the assault on the catholic church let me make it absolutely clear no religious institution catholic or otherwise including catholic social services georgetown hospital mercy hospital any hospital none has to either refer contraception none has to pay for contraception none has to be a vehicle to get contraception in any insurance policy they provide,Premise
we dont think that unelected judges should make this decision,Claim
that people through their elected representatives in reaching a consensus in society through the democratic process should make this determination,Claim
the policy of a romney administration is to oppose abortion with exceptions for rape incest and life of the mother,Claim
thats a principle,Premise
if you believe that life begins at conception that therefore doesnt change the definition of life,Premise
i suspect that would happen,Claim
i guarantee you that will not happen,Claim
we pick people who are openminded,Premise
we picked two people,Premise
the court  the next president will get one or two supreme court nominees,Premise
do you think hes likely to appoint someone like scalia or someone else on the court far right that would outlaw inaudible  outlaw abortion,Premise
just ask yourself with robert bork being the chief adviser on the court for  for mr romney who do you think hes likely to appoint,Premise
thats how close roe v wade is,Premise
theyve been good justices,Premise
there was no litmus test,Claim
we picked people who had an open mind,Premise
did not come with an agenda,Premise
i would say to him the same thing i say to my son who did serve a year in iraq,Premise
we only have one truly sacred obligation as a government,Claim
thats to equip those we send into harms way and care for those who come home,Claim
thats the only sacred obligation we have,Claim
everything else falls behind that,Claim
i would also tell him that the fact that he this decorated soldier you talked about fought for his country that that should be honored,Claim
he should not be thrown into a category of a 47 percent who dont pay their taxes while he was out there fighting and not having to pay taxes and somehow not taking responsibility,Claim
i would also tell him that there are things that have occurred in this campaign and occur in every campaign that im sure both of us regret anyone having said,Claim
particularly in these  these special new groups that can go out there raise all the money they want not have to identify themselves who say the most scurrilous things about the other candidate,Premise
its an abomination,Claim
there are things that have been said in campaigns that i  i find not very appealing,Claim
id thank him to his service to our country,Claim
id ask that hero you referenced to take a look at whether or not governor romney or president obama has the conviction to help lift up the middle class restore them to where they were before this great recession hit and they got wiped out,Claim
or whether or not hes going to continue to focus on taking care of only the very wealthy not asking them to make  pay any part of the deal to bring  bring back the middle class and the economy of this country,Claim
id ask him to take a look at whether the president of the united states has acted wisely in the use of force and whether or not the slipshod comments being made by my  my  or by governor romney serve  serve our interests very wel,Claim
id say we are not going to impose these devastating cuts on our military which compromises their mission and their safety,Claim
then i would say you have a president who ran for president four years ago promising hope and change who has now turned his campaign into attack blame and defame,Claim
if you dont have a good record to run on then you paint your opponent as someone to run from,Premise
that was what president obama said in 2008,Premise
its what hes doing right now,Claim
look at all the string of broken promises,Claim
if you like your health care plan you can keep it,Premise
try telling that to the 20 million people who are projected to lose their health insurance if obamacare goes through or the 7point million  74 million seniors who are going to lose it,Premise
or remember when he said this i guarantee if you make less than 250000 your taxes wont go up,Premise
of the 21 tax increases in obamacare 12 of them hit the middle class,Premise
remember when he said health insurance premiums will go down 2500 per family per year,Premise
remember when he said i promise by the end of my first term ill cut the deficit in half in four years,Premise
theyve gone up 3000 and theyre expected to go up another 2400,Premise
weve had four budgets four trilliondollar deficits,Premise
a debt crisis is coming,Premise
we cant keep spending and borrowing like this,Claim
we cant keep spending money we dont have,Claim
mitt romney is uniquely qualified to fix these problems,Claim
his lifetime of experience his proven track record of bipartisanship,Premise
he broke his big promise to bring people together to solve the countrys biggest problems,Claim
what i would tell him is we dont have to settle for this,Claim
mitt romneys put ideas on the table,Premise
i passed two budgets to deal with this,Premise
president obama has not even put a credible plan on the table in any of his four years to deal with this debt crisis,Premise
weve got to tackle this debt crisis before it tackles us,Premise
thats what we get in this administration  speeches,Claim
were not getting leadership,Claim
the president likes to say he has a plan,Premise
they said its a speech we cant estimate speeches,Premise
we asked the congressional budget office tell us what president obamas plan is to prevent a debt crisis,Premise
he gave us a copy of the speech,Premise
they sent us to the press secretary,Premise
we asked his budget office can we see the plan,Premise
he gave a speech,Premise
we can do better than this,Claim
the two budgets the congressman introduced have eviscerated all the things that the middle class cares about,Claim
it is inaudible he will knock 19 million people off of medicare,Premise
it does virtually nothing except continue to increase the tax cuts for the very wealthy,Premise
it cuts education by 450 billion,Premise
it will eliminate the tax credit people have to be able to send their children to college,Premise
it will kick 200000 children off of early education,Premise
there are plenty of fine people who could lead this country,Premise
what you need are people who when they say theyre going to do something they go do it,Claim
what you need are when people see problems they offer solutions to fix those problems,Claim
were not getting that,Claim
we can grow this economy faster,Claim
thats what our five point plan for a stronger middle class is all about,Premise
its about getting 12 million jobs higher takehome pay getting people out of poverty into the middle class,Claim
that means going with proven pro growth policies that we know works to get people back to work,Claim
putting ideas on the table working with democrats,Claim

my whole life has been devoted to leveling the playing field for middleclass people,Premise
look at my record,Premise
its been all about the middle class,Claim
theyre the people who grow this country,Claim
we think you grow this country from the middle out not from the top down,Claim
you probably detected my frustration with their attitude about the american people,Claim
hes talking about my mother and father,Premise
romney points out 47 percent of the people wont take responsibility,Premise
my friend says that 30 percent of the american people are takers,Premise
hes talking about the places i grew up in my neighbors in scranton and claymont,Premise
hes talking about the people that have built this country,Premise
all theyre looking for is an even shot,Claim
whenever you give them the shot theyve done it,Premise
theyve done it,Premise
whenever youve leveled the playing field theyve been able to move,Premise
they want a little bit of peace of mind,Claim
the president and i are not going to rest until that playing field is leveled they in fact have a clear shot and they have peace of mind until they can turn to their kid and say with a degree of confidence honey its going to be ok its going to be ok,Claim
his economic agenda more spending more borrowing higher taxes a government takeover of health care its not working,Claim
president obama he had his chance,Premise
he made his choices,Premise
its failed to create the jobs we need,Claim
twentythree million americans are struggling for work today,Premise
fifteen percent of americans are in poverty,Premise
mitt romney is uniquely qualified to get this job done,Claim
his experience his ideas his solutions,Premise
mitt romney and i will not duck the tough issues,Claim
we will not blame others for the next four years,Claim
we will take responsibility,Claim
we will not try to replace our founding principles,Claim
we will reapply our founding principles,Claim
were offering real reforms for a real recovery for every american,Claim
this is not what a real recovery looks like,Premise
well never have uh  an end to the inflationary spiral and well never have a balanced budget,Claim
until we get our people back to work,Premise
there are several things that can be done specifically that are not now being done,Claim
first of all to channel research and development funds into areas that will provide uh large numbers of jobs,Premise
secondly we need to have a commitment in the uh private sector uh  to cooperate with government in matters like housing,Premise
this is uh  an effort that ought to be done primarily by strong leadership in the white house the inspiration of our people the tapping of uh  business agriculture industry labor and government at all levels to work on this uh project,Claim
a very small investment of taxpayers money  in the housing field can bring large numbers of extra jobs and the guarantee of mortgage loans and the uh  putting forward of uh  two0two programs for housing for older people and so forth to cut down the roughly 20 percent unemployment that now exists in the  in the construction industry,Premise
another thing is to deal with our  uh needs in the central cities where the unemployment rate is extremely high sometimes among minority groups or those who dont speak english or whore black or young people or  40 percent of the employment,Premise
here a ccc type program would be appropriate to channel money into the ah  cha in  in into the sharing with the private sector and also local and state governments to employ young people who are now out of work,Premise
these uh  kinds of specific things uh none of which are being done now would be a great help in  in reducing uh unemployment,Claim
another very important  uh aspect of our  uh economy would be to increase production in every way possible uh to hold down  uh taxes on individuals and to uh shift the tax burdens onto those who have avoided paying taxes in the past,Premise
there is uh  uh an additional factor that needs to be done and covered very  very succinctly and that is to make sure that we have a good relationship between management  business on the one hand and labor on the other,Claim
we might channel specific uh targeted job  job  uh opportunities by paying part of the salary of unemployed people  uh and also sharing with uh  local governments the uh  payment of salaries which would uh  let us cut down the unemployment rate much lower before we hit the inflationary level,Premise
i believe that by the end of the first four years of uh  of the next term we could have the unemployment down to 3 percent adult unemployment,Claim
which is about uh  4 to 4 and a half percent overall uh controlled inflation rate and have a uh balance of growth of about  uh 4 to 6 percent around 5 percent which would give us a balanced budget,Premise
we now have such uh  a low utilization of uh  our productive capacity  uh about 73 percent,Premise
i think its about the lowest since the great depression years,Premise
and such a high unemployment rate now  uh 79 percent,Premise
we have a long way to go in getting people to work before we have the inflationary pressures,Claim
i think this would uh  this would be uh easy to accomplish to get jobs down without having strong in inflationary pressures that  that would be necessary,Claim
i would not favor the uh  payment of uh  of a given fixed income to people unless they are not able to work,Claim
with tax incentives for the lowincome groups we could build up their uh  income levels uh  above the poverty level and not uh make welfare more uh  profitable than  than work,Premise
i dont believe that uh that mr carters been any more specific in this case than he has been on many other instances,Claim
i notice particularly that he didnt endorse the humphreyhawkins bill which he has on occasions and which is included as a part of the democratic platform,Premise
that legislation uh allegedly would help our unemployment,Premise
we all know that it wouldve controlled our economy,Claim
it wouldve added uh  ten to thirty billion dollars each year in additional expenditures by the federal government,Premise
it wouldve called for export controls on agricultural products,Premise
in my judgment the best way to get jobs is to uh  expand the private sector,Claim
where five out of six jobs today exist in our economy,Premise
we can do that by reducing federal taxes,Claim
as i proposed uh  about a year ago when i called for a tax reduction of 28 billion,Premise
threequarters of it to go to private uh taxpayers and uh onequarter to the business sector,Premise
we could add to jobs in the major metropolitan areas by a proposal that i recommended that would give tax incentives to business to move into the inner city and to expand or to build new plants,Claim
so that they would take a plant or expand a plant where people are and people are currently unemployed,Premise
we could uh  also uh  help our youths with some of the proposals that uh  would give to young people an opportunity to work and learn at the same time,Claim
just like we give money to young people who are going to college,Premise
those are the kind of specifics that i think we have to discuss on these uh  debates,Claim
these are the kind of programs that ill talk about on my time,Claim
that presumably would cost the treasury quite a bit of money in lost revenue,Claim
you have said that you favor more tax cuts for middleincome americans  even those earning up to 30 thousand a year,Premise
with the help of the congress we can justify fully a 28 billion tax reduction,Claim
if we keep the lid on federal spending,Premise
we can fully justify the tax reductions that i have proposed,Claim
with that kind of limitation on federal spending,Premise
at the time mr gannon that i made the recommendation for a 28 billion tax cut  threequarters of it to go to individual taxpayers and 25 percent to american business,Premise
i said at the time that we had to hold the lid an federal spending that for every dollar of a tax reduction we had to have an equal reduction in federal expenditures  a oneforone proposition,Premise
i recommended that to the congress with a budget ceiling of three hundred and ninetyfive billion dollars and that would have permitted us to have a 25 billion tax reduction,Premise
in my tax reduction program for middleincome taxpayers i recommended that the congress increase personal exemptions from seven hundred and fifty dollars per person to one thousand dollars per person,Premise
that would mean of course that for a family of four that that family would have a thousand dollars more personal exemption  money that they could spend for their own purposes money that the government wouldnt have to spend,Premise
for the last ten years the budget of the united states has grown from uh  about 11 percent per year,Premise
we cant afford that kind of growth in federal spending,Premise
in the budget that i submitted to the congress in january this year i re recommended a 50 percent cutback in the rate of growth of federal spending,Premise
in the budget that i recommended we cut it in half  a growth rate of 5 to 5 and onehalf percent,Premise
our economy stimulated so that well get more revenue and well have a more prosperous economy,Claim
with the stimulant of more money in the hands of the taxpayers and with more money in the hands of business to expand to modernize to provide more jobs,Premise
congress could have done that,Claim
if the budget committees of the congress and the congress as a whole had not increased the spending that i recommended in the budget,Premise
im sure that you know that in the resolutions passed by the congress that have added about 17 billion in more spending by the congress over the budget that i recommended,Premise
that tax bill does not entirely meet the criteria that i established,Claim
the congress should have uh  added another 10 billion reduction in personal income taxes including the increase of personal exemptions from seven hundred and fifty to a thousand dollars,Premise
from the a analysis that ive made so far it seems to me that that tax bill does uh  justify my signature and my approval,Claim
i would prefer in that tax bill to have an additional tax cut and a further limitation on federal spending,Premise
this tax bill  that hasnt reached the white house yet but is expected in a day or two  its about fifteen hundred pages,Premise
it has some good provisions in it,Premise
it has  uh left out some that i have recommended unfortunately,Premise
on the other hand uh when you have a bill of that magnitude with  tho those many provisions a president has to sit and decide if theres more good than bad,Premise
the present tax structure is a disgrace to this country,Claim
its just a welfare program for the rich,Claim
25 percent of the total tax deductions go for only 1 percent of the richest people in this country,Premise
over 50 percent of the tax uh credits go for the 14 percent of the richest people in this country,Premise
when mr ford first became president in  in august of 1974 the first thing he did in  in october was to ask for a 47 billion increase in taxes on our people in the midst of the heaviest recession since uh  since the great depression of nineteen uh  of the 1940s,Premise
in uh  january of 1975 he asked for a tax change a 56 billion increase on lowandmiddleincome private individuals a six and a half billion dollar decrease on the corporations and the special interests,Premise
in uh  december of uh  1975 he vetoed the roughly 18 to 20 billion dollar uh taxreduction bill that had been passed by the congress,Premise
then he came back later on in january of this year and he did advocate a 10 billion tax reduction but it would be offset by a 6 billion increase this coming january in deductions for social security payments and for unemployment compensation,Premise
the whole philosophy of the republican party including uh  my opponent has been to pile on taxes on lowincome people to take em off on the corporations,Claim
mr ford is  is uh changing uh considerably his previous philosophy,Claim
as a matter fact in  sin since the late sixties when mr nixon took office weve had a reduction in uh  in the percentage of taxes paid by corporations from 30 percent down to about 20 percent,Premise
weve had an increase in taxes paid by individuals payroll taxes from14 percent up to 20 percent,Premise
this is what the republicans have done to us,Premise
this is why a tax reform is so important,Claim
there still isnt enough money to pay for those programs and balance the budget by any  any estimates that ive been able to see,Claim
if we price them conservatively and we count for full employment by the end of your first term and we count for the economic growth that would occur during that period,Premise
you havent put a price tag on those programs,Premise
youve also said that you wanna balance the budget by the end of your first term,Premise
you proposed a number of new or enlarged programs including jobs health welfare reform child care aid to education aid to cities changes in social security and housing subsidies,Premise
as a matter of fact there is,Claim
if we assume the ah  uh  a rate of growth of our economy equivalent to what it was during president johnson president kennedy even before the  the  the  uh wa uh  vietnese namese war,Premise
if we assume that at the end of the fouryear period we can cut our unemployment rate down to 4 to 4 and a half percent,Premise
under those circumstances even assuming no elimination of unnecessary programs and assuming an increase in the ad in the allotment of money to finance programs increasing as the inflation rate does  my economic projections i think confirmed by the house uh  and the senate committees have been with the 60 billion extra amount of money that can be spent in fiscal year 81 which will be the last year of this next term,Premise
within that sixtybillion dollars increase there would be fit the programs that i promised the american people,Claim
if we see that these goals cannot be reached,Premise
i believe theyre reasonable goals,Claim
i would cut back on the rate of implement implementation of new programs in order to accommodate a balanced budget by fiscal year 81 which is the last year of the next term,Claim
i believe that we ought to have a balanced budget during normal economic circumstances,Claim
these projections have been very carefully made,Premise
i stand behind them,Claim
ill phase in the programs that weve uh  advocated more slowly,Claim
if they should be in error slightly on the down side,Premise
according to the budget committees of the congress tha tha tha that you referred to if we get to full employment  what they project at a 4 percent unemployment  and as you say even allowing for the inflation in the programs there would not be anything more than a surplus of 5 billion by the end of ninet by 1981,Premise
conservative estimates of your programs would be that theyd be about 85 to a hundred billion dollars,Premise
well have uh  a safety version built in with complete reorganization of the executive branch of government which i am pledged to do,Claim
the present bureaucratic structure of the  of the federal government is a mess,Premise
if im elected president thats gonna be a top priority of mine to completely revise the structure of the federal government to make it economical efficient purposeful and manageable for a change,Claim
im going to institute zerobased budgeting,Claim
which i used four years in georgia,Premise
which uh  assesses every program every year and eliminates those programs that are obsolete or obsolescent,Premise
we will have a balanced budget by fiscal year 1981,Claim
if im elected president,Premise
the committees to whom you refer with the  the employment that you uh  state and with the 5 to 5 and a half percent growth rate in our economy that the uh  projections would be a uh  a 60 billion increase in the amount of money that wed have to spend in l981 compared to now,Premise
in that framework would befit the  any improvements in the programs,Premise
this does not include uh  any uh  uh extra control over uh unnecessary spending the weeding out of obsolete or obsolescent programs,Premise
keep my promises to the american people,Claim
its just predicated on very modest but i think accurate projections of employment increases and uh  a growth in our national economy equal to what was experienced under kennedy johnson before the vietnam war,Claim
i think the american taxpayer ought to get an additional tax break  a tax reduction of that magnitude,Claim
if it is uh true that there will be a 60 billion surplus by fiscal year 1981 rather than spend that money for all the new programs that governor carter recommends and endorses and which are included in the democratic platform,Premise
the taxpayers are the ones that need the relief,Premise
i dont think we should add additional programs of the magnitude that governor carter talks about,Claim
we can give taxpayers adequate tax relief,Claim
by eliminating ten million taxpayers in the last uh eight years,Premise
by putting a heavier tax burden on those in the higher tax brackets plus the other actions thatve been taken,Premise
there isnt going to be any 60 billion dividend,Claim
as we look at the recommendations of the budget committees and our own projections,Premise
ive heard of those dividends in the past,Premise
it always happens,Premise
we expected one at the time of the vietnam war but it was used up before we ever ended the war and taxpayers never got the adequate relief they deserved,Premise
since 1969 during a republican administrations we have had ten million people taken off of the tax rolls at the lower end of the taxpayer area,Premise
at the same time assuming that i sign the tax bill that was mentioned by mr gannon we will in the last two tax bills have increased the minimum tax on all wealthy taxpayers,Premise
mr nixon resigned,Premise
that is disgrace,Claim
the first president out of thirtyeight that ever resigned from public office under pressure,Premise
i am against an acrosstheboard pardon of draft evaders or military deserters,Claim
the amnesty program that i recommended in chicago in september of 1974 would give to all draft evaders and  uh military deserters the opportunity to earn their uh  good record back,Premise
about fourteen to fifteen thousand did take advantage of that program,Premise
we gave them ample time,Premise
n the case of mr nixon the reason the  the pardon was given was that when i took office this country was in a very very divided condition,Claim
there was hatred there was divisiveness,Premise
people had lost faith in their government in many many respects,Premise
mr nixon resigned and i became president,Premise
it seemed to me that if i was to uh adequately and effectively handle the problems of high inflation a growing recession the uh  involvement of the united states still in vietnam that i had to give a hundred percent of my time to those two major problems,Premise
it seemed to me that mr nixon had been penalized enough by his resignation in disgrace and the need and necessity for me to concentrate on the problems of the country fully justified the action that i took,Claim
when you look at the penalty that he paid,Premise
when you analyze the requirements that i had  to spend all of my time working on the economy which was in trouble that i inherited,Premise
working on our problems in southeast asia  which were still plaguing us,Premise
i do not agree with that point of view,Claim
i gave in september of 1974 an opportunity for all draft evaders all deserters to come in voluntarily clear their records by earning an opportunity to restore their good citizenship,Premise
i think we gave them a good opportunity,Claim
i dont think we should go any further,Claim
i dont advocate amnesty,Claim
i advocate pardon,Claim
theres a difference in my opinion,Claim
in accordance with the ruling of the supreme court and accordance with the definition in the dictionary,Premise
amnesty means that  that you uh  that what you did was right,Premise
pardon means that what you did whether its right or wrong youre forgiven for it,Premise
i do advocate a pardon for  for draft evaders,Claim
two years ago when mr nixon  mr ford put in this uh amnesty that three times as many deserters were uh  excused as were  as were the uh  the ones who evaded the draft,Premise
i think that now is the time to heal our country after the vietnam war,Claim
i think that what the people are concerned about is not the  uh pardon or the amnesty of uh  those who evaded the draft but  but whether or not our crime system is  is fair,Claim
weve got a  a sharp distinction drawn between white collar crime  the  the  the big shots who are rich who are influential uh very seldom go to jail,Premise
those who are poor and  and who have uh no influence  uh quite often are the ones who are punished,Premise
the whole uh subject of crime is one that concerns our people very much,Premise
i believe that the fairness of it is  is what  uh  is a  is a major problem that addresses our  our leader,Claim
this is something that hasnt been addressed adequately by  by this administration,Claim
i hope to have a complete uh responsibility on my shoulders to help bring about a  a fair uh  criminal justice system and also to  to bring about uh  an end to the  to the divise divisiveness that has occurred in our country uh as a result of the vietnam war,Claim
ive been through this before,Claim
as the governor of georgia,Premise
when i took aver we had uh a bureaucratic mess like we have in washington now and we had three hundred agencies departments bureaus commissions  uh some uh  fully budgeted some not but all having responsibility to carry out that was in conflict,Premise
we cut those three hundred  uh agencies and so forth down substantially,Premise
we eliminated two hundred and seventyeight of them,Premise
we set up a simple structure of government that could be administrated fairly,Premise
it was a  a tremendous success,Premise
it hasnt been undone since i was there,Premise
it resulted also in an ability to reshape our court system our prison system our education system our mental health programs and  and a clear assignment of responsibility and  and authority and also to have uh our people once again understanding control our government,Premise
i intend to do the same thing,Claim
if im elected president,Premise
when i get to washington coming in as an outsider one of the major responsibilities that  that i will have on my shoulder is a complete reorganization of the  of the executive branch of government,Claim
this needs to be changed,Claim
we now have uh  a greatly expanded white house staff,Premise
when mr nixon went in office for instance we had three and a half million dollars spent on  on the white house and its staff,Premise
that has escalated now to sixteen and a half million dollars in the last uh republican administration,Premise
we need to put the responsibilities back on the cabinet members,Claim
we also need to have a great reduction in agencies and programs,Claim
for instance we now have uh  in the health area three hundred and two different programs administered by eleven major departments and agencies sixty other advisory commissions responsible for this,Premise
medicaids in one agency,Premise
medicare is in a different one,Premise
the check on the quality of health care is in a different one,Premise
none of them uh are responsible for health care itself,Premise
this makes it almost impossible for us to have a good health program,Claim
our country now has no comprehensive energy program or policy,Claim
we have uh  just advocated uh  this past week a consolidation of the responsibilities for energy,Premise
we have twenty different agencies in the federal government responsible for the production the regulation the uh  information about energy the conservation of energy spread all over government,Premise
its gonna be done,Claim
if im elected,Premise
this is a  a gross waste of money,Premise
tough competent management of government giving us a simple efficient purposeful and manageable government would be a great step forward,Claim
i cant say for sure that we would have fewer federal employees when i go out of office than when i come in,Claim
it took me about three years to completely reorganize the georgia government,Premise
the last year i was in office uh  our budget was  was actually less than it was a year before uh which showed a great uh improvement,Premise
we had a  a 2 percent increase in the number of employees the last year,Premise
it was a tremendous shift from administrative jobs into the delivery of services,Claim
for instance we uh  completely revised our prison system,Premise
we established eightyfour new mental health treatment centers,Premise
we shifted people out of administrative jobs into the field to deliver better services,Premise
the same thing will be done uh  at the federal government level,Claim
i  i accomplished this with s  substantial reductions in employees in some departments,Claim
for instance in the transportation department uh we had uh  we cut back about 25 percent of the total number of employees,Premise
we uh  have got to do that at the federal government level,Claim
the bureaucratic mess is going to continue,Claim

he testified and these are his words  the present governor of georgia  he says he found the medicaid program in georgia in shambles,Premise
i think our record of cutting back employees plus the failure on the part of the governors programs to actually save employment in georgia shows which is the better plan,Claim
the first order that i issued after i became president was to cut or eliminate the prospective fortythousand increase in federal employees that had been scheduled by my predecessor,Premise
in the term that ive been president  some two years  we have reduced federal employment by eleven thousand,Premise

that doesnt cost any more as far as the federal treasury is concerned,Premise
that doesnt cost any more money,Premise
as we look at the qualityoflife programs  jobs health education crime recreation  we feel that as we move forward with a healthier economy we can absorb the small necessary cost that will be required,Claim
its my understanding that governor carter has indicated that uh  he approves of a 30 billion uh  expenditure by the federal government as far as education is concerned,Premise
at the present time were spending roughly three billion five hundred million dollars,Premise

we feel that uh  in education we can have a slight increase  not a major increase,Premise

we will have the lower rate of inflation for the uh  calendar year this year  something slightly under 6 percent,Premise
employment will be up,Premise
revenues will be up,Premise
well keep the lid on some of these programs that we can hold down as we have a little extra money to spend for those qualityoflife programs which i think are needed and necessary,Premise
he endorses the democratic uh  platform which as i read it calls for approximately sixty additional programs,Premise
those programs you cannot afford and give tax relief,Claim
we estimate that those programs would add a hundred billion dollars minimum and probably two hundred billion dollars  uhh maximum each year to the federal budget,Premise
we feel that you can hold the line and restrain federal spending give a tax reduction and still have a balanced budget by 1978,Claim
mr ford takes the uh  same attitude that the republicans always take,Claim
in the last three months before an election theyre always for the programs that they always fight the other threeandonehalf years,Claim
i remember when uh  herbert hoover was against uh  jobs for people,Premise
i remember when alf landon was against social security,Premise
later president nixon sixteen years ago was telling the public that john kennedys proposals would bankrupt the country and would double the cost,Premise

among my other experiences in the past ive  ive been a nuclear engineer and did graduate work in this field,Premise
were gonna run out of oil,Claim
when mr nixon made his famous uh speech on operation independence we were importing about 35 percent of our oil,Premise
now weve increased that amount 25 percent,Premise
we now import about 44 percent of our oil,Premise
we need to shift from oil to coal,Claim
we need to concentrate our research and development effort on uh coal burning and extraction with safer mines but also its clean burning,Claim
we need to shift very strongly toward solar energy and have strict conservation measures,Claim
the energy  uh policy of our nation is one that uh has not yet been established under this administration,Claim
i think almost every other developed nation in the world has an energy policy except us,Premise
we have seen uh  the federal energy agency established for instance,Premise
in the crisis of 1973 it was supposed to be a temporary agency uh now its permanent its enormous its growing every day,Premise
i think the wall street journal uh reported not too long ago they have a hundred and twelve public relations experts working for the federal energy agency to try to justify to the american people its own existence,Premise
weve got to have a  a firm way to handle the energy question,Claim
the reorganization proposal that i have put forward is one uh first step,Claim
weve got uh about thirtyfive years worth of oil left in the whole world,Premise
i would certainly uh  not cut out atomic power altogether,Claim
we cant afford to give up that opportunity until later,Premise
as a last resort only continue to use atomic power,Premise
to the extent that we continue to use atomic power i would be responsible as president to make sure that the safety precautions were initiated and maintained,Claim
we need to have the reactor core  below ground level the entire power plant that uses atomic uh  power tightly sealed and a heavy  heavy vacuum maintained,Premise
these kinds of uh  procedures along with evacuation procedures adequate insurance ought to be initiated,Claim
there ought to be a standardized design,Claim
there ought to be a fulltime uh  atomic energy specialist independent of the power company in the control room full time twentyfour hours a day,Claim
to shut down a plant if an abnormality develops,Premise
thats the best overall energy policy in the brief time we have to discuss it,Claim
shift from oil to coal,Premise
emphasize research and development on coal use and also on solar power,Premise
strict conservation measures,Premise
not yield every time that the special interest groups uh  put pressure on the president like uh this administration has done,Premise
use atomic energy only as a last resort with the strictest possible safety precautions,Premise
yes i would,Claim
some of the things that can be done about this is a change in the rate structure of electric power companies,Claim
we uh  now encourage people to waste electricity and uh  by giving uh  the lowest rates to the biggest users,Premise
we dont do anything to cut down on peak load requirements,Premise
we dont have an adequate requirement for the insulation of homes for the efficiency of automobiles,Premise
whenever the uh  automobile manufacturers come forward and say they cant meet the uh  amendments that the congress has put forward this republican administration has delayed the implementation dates,Premise
in addition to that we ought to have a  a shift toward the use of coal particularly in the appalachian regions where the coal is located,Claim
a lot of uh  very high quality lowcarbon coal uh  lowsulfur coal is there,Premise
its where our employment is needed,Premise
this would  would help a great deal,Claim
the private sector ought to be encouraged to  to bring forward to the public the benefits from efficiency,Claim
one bank in uh  washington fo for instance gives lower interest loans for people who adequately insulate their homes or who buy efficient automobiles,Premise
mandatory conservation measures  yes,Claim
encouragement by the president for people to uh voluntarily conserve  yes,Claim
some major uh  uh  manufacturing companies like dow chemical have through uh  very effective efficiency mechanism cut down the use of energy by uh  as much as 40 percent with the same outproduct,Premise
these kinds of things uh  ought to be done,Claim
they ought to be encouraged and supported and even required uh by the government yes,Claim
were going as fast as the experts say we should,Claim
i think you have to have greater oil and gas production more coal production more nuclear production,Claim
in addition you have to have energy conservation,Claim
i submitted to the congress and to the american people the first comprehensive energy program recommended by any president,Claim
it called for an increase in the production of energy in the united states,Premise
it called for uh  conservation measures so that we would save the energy that we have,Premise
you have to give those producers an opportunity to uh  develop their land or their wells,Claim
if youre going to increase domestic oil and gas production,Premise
i recommended to the congress that we should increase production in this country from six hundred million tons a year to twel a a billion two hundred million tons by 1985,Premise
in nuclear power we have increased the research and development uh  under the energy research and development agency uh  very substantially,Claim
to insure that our ener uh  nuclear power plants are safer,Premise
that they are more efficient,Premise
that we have adequate safeguards,Premise
in order to do that we have to improve our extraction of coal from the ground,Claim
we have to improve our utilization of coal  make it more efficient make it cleaner,Claim
we uh  have to expand our research and development,Claim
in my program for energy independence we have increased for example solar energy research from about 84 million a year to about a hundred and twenty million dollars a year,Premise
it is better to pay out unemployment compensation to idle people than to put them to work in public service jobs,Claim
you have vetoed or threatened to veto number of job bills passed or uh  in development in the democratic congress  democraticcontrolled congress,Premise
at the same time the government is paying out uh  i think it is 17 billion perhaps 20 billion a year in unemployment compensation caused by the high unemployment,Premise
the bills that i vetoed the one for an additional 6 billion was not a bill that would have solved our unemployment problems,Claim
even the proponents of it admitted that no more than four hundred thousand jobs would be uh  made available,Premise
our analysis indicates that something in the magnitude of about one hundred fifty to two hundred thousand jobs would uh  be made available,Premise
each one of those jobs wouldve cost the taxpayers 25 thousand,Premise
the immediate problem we have is to stimulate our economy now so that we can get rid of unemployment,Claim
we have proven i think very conclusively that you can reduce the rate of inflation and increase jobs,Claim
for example as i have said we have added some four million jobs in the last seventeen months,Premise
we have now employed eightyeight million people in america the largest number in the history of the united states,Premise
weve added five hundred thousand jobs in the last two months,Premise
inflation is the quickest way to destroy jobs,Premise
in addition the jobs would not be available right now,Premise
they would not have materialized for about nine to eighteen months,Premise
what we have done is to hold the lid on spending in an effort to reduce the rate of inflation,Premise
by holding the lid on federal spending we have been able to do an a good job an affirmative job in inflation and as a result have added to the jobs in this country,Claim
its my  my opinion that the private sector is a better place than makework jobs under the program recommended by the congress,Claim
where five out of six jobs are,Premise
where you have permanent jobs with the opportunity for advancement,Premise
through our tax policies we have stimulated uhh  added employment throughout the country,Claim
the investment tax credit,Premise
the tax incentives for expansion and modernization of our industrial capacity,Premise
i am not in a position to make any judgment on it tonight,Claim
that bill has not yet come down to the oval office,Premise
that is an extra 4 billion that would uh  add to the deficit which would add to the inflationary pressures which would help to destroy jobs in the private sector  not make jobs where the jobs really are,Claim
these makework temporary jobs  dead end as they are  are not the kind of jobs that we want for our people,Premise
we have saved over 9 billion in federal expenditures,Claim
in the uh  two years that ive been president ive vetoed fiftysix bills,Premise
congress has sustained fortytwo vetoes,Premise
he cant have it both ways,Claim
it seems to me that we should hold the lid as we have to the best of our ability,Claim
so we can stimulate the private economy and get the jobs where the jobs are  five out of six in this economy,Premise
the congress by overriding the bills that i did veto the congress has added some 13 billion to the federal expenditures and to the federal deficit,Premise
governor carter complains about the deficits that uh  uh  this administration has had,Premise
yet he condemns the vetoes that i have made that has  that have saved the taxpayer 9 billion and could have saved an additional 13 billion,Premise
this affects human beings,Claim
his insensitivity in providing those people a chance to work has made this a welfare administration and not a work administration,Claim
he hasnt saved 9 billion with his vetoes,Claim
theres only been uh  a net savings of 4 billion,Claim
this touches human beings,Claim
five hundred thousand more people are out of work than there were three months ago,Premise
we have two and a half million more people out of work than were when he took office,Premise
i was in uh  a city in uh  pennsylvania not too long ago near here and uh  there were about four or five thousand people in the audience  it was on a  on a train trip,Premise
and i said how many uh  adults here are out of work about a thousand raised their hands,Premise
mr ford uh  actually has fewer people now in the private sector in nonfarm jobs than when he took office,Premise
still he talks about  uh success,Premise
seven point nine percent unemployment is a terrible tragedy in this country,Claim
he says hes learned how to match unemployment with inflation,Premise
weve got the highest inflation weve had in twentyfive years right now except under this administration and that was fifty years ago,Premise
weve got uh  the highest unemployment weve had uh  under mr fords administration since the great depression,Premise
this is a  a typical attitude that really causes havoc in peoples lives,Premise
its a travesty,Claim
it shows a lack of leadership,Claim
then its covered over by saying that our country has naturally got a 6 percent unemployment rate or 7 percent unemployment rate and a 6 percent inflation,Premise
the cost in unemployment compensation welfare compensation and lost revenues has increased 23 billion in the last two years,Claim
weve never had a president since the war between the states that vetoed more bills,Premise
mr ford has vetoed four times as many bills as mr nixon  per year,Premise
eleven of em have been overridden,Premise
one of his bills that was overridden  he only got one vote in the senate and seven votes in the house from republicans,Premise
this shows a breakdown in leadership,Claim
you cant really raise sufficient revenue to provide an overall tax cut of any size,Claim
unless youre willing to do such things as reduce the itemized deductions for charitable contributions or home mortgage payments or interest or taxes or capital gains,Premise
we have uh such a grossly unbalanced tax system,Claim
of all the tax  benefits now 25 percent of em go to the 1 percent of the richest people in this country,Premise
over 50 percent  53 to be exact  percent of the tax benefits go to the 14 percent richest people in this country,Premise
weve had a 50 percent increase in payroll deductions since mr nixon went in office eight years ago,Premise
thats got to be changed,Claim
mr ford has  has advocated since hes been in office over 5 billion in reductions for corporations special interest groups and the very very wealthy who derive their income  not from labor  but from investments,Premise
a few things that can be done,Claim
the average american pays the taxes for them,Claim
when they dont pay their taxes,Premise
we have now a deferral system so that the multinational corporations who invest overseas  if they make a million dollars in profits overseas  they dont have to pay any of their taxes unless they bring their money back into this country,Premise
it robs this country of jobs,Claim
instead of coming back with that million dollars and creating a shoe factory say in new hampshire or vermont if the company takes the money down to italy and  and builds a shoe factory they dont have to pay any taxes on the money,Premise
the average american taxpayer pays it for em,Claim
when those rich corporations dont pay that tax,Premise
another thing is a system called disc which was originally designed proposed by mr nixon to encourage exports,Premise
this permits a company to create uh  a dummy corporation to export their products and then not to pay the full amount of taxes on them,Premise
this costs our uh  government about uh  14 billion a year,Premise
these special kinds of programs have  have robbed the average taxpayer and have benefited those who are powerful and who can employ lobbyists and who can have their cpas and their lawyers to help them benefit from the roughly uh  eight thousand pages of the tax code,Claim
the average uh american person cant do it,Claim
you cant hire a lobbyist uh out of unemployment compensation checks,Premise
another one thats uh  thats very important is the uh  is the business deductions uh  jet airplanes uh  first class travel the fiftydollar martini lunch,Premise
the average working person cant  uh  cant take advantage of that but the  the wealthier people  uh can,Premise
another system is where uhh  a dentist can invest money in say raising cattle and uh  can put in a hundred thousand dollars of his own money borrow nine hundred thousand dollars  nine hundred mi thousand dollars  that makes a million  and mark off a great amount of uh  of loss uh  through that procedure,Premise
there was one example for instance where uh  somebody uh  produced pornographic movies,Premise
they put in 30 thousand of their own money and got a hundred and twenty thousand dollars in tax savings,Premise
no i wouldnt do away with all  uh business deductions,Claim
i think that would be a  a very serious mistake,Claim
you could lower taxes for everyone,Claim
if you could just do away with the ones that are unfair,Premise
i would never do anything that would increase the taxes for those who work for a living or who are presently required to list all their income,Claim
what i wanna do is not to raise taxes but to eliminate loopholes,Claim
i think this is the very best way to approach it,Claim
the point of my first statistics that i gave you  that  that the present tax benefits that have been carved out over a long period of years  fifty years  by sharp tax lawyers and by lobbyists have benefited just the rich,Premise
these programs that i described to you earlier  the tax deferrals for overseas the disc and the tax shelters uh  they only apply to people in the 50 thousandayear bracket or up,Premise
make sure that everybody pays taxes on the income that they earn,Claim
make sure that you take whatever savings there is from the higher income levels and give it to the lower and middleincome families,Claim
governor carters answer tonight does not coincide with the answer that he gave in an interview to the associated press a week or so ago,Claim
in that interview uh  governor carter indicated that uh  he would raise the taxes on those in the medium or middleincome brackets or higher,Premise
if you uh  take the medium or middleincome taxpayer  thats about 14 thousand per person  uh  governor carter has indicated publicly in an interview that he would increase the taxes on about 50 percent of the working people of this country,Premise
i think uh  the way to get tax equity in this country is to give tax relief to the middleincome people who have an income from roughly 8 thousand up to twentyfive or thirty thousand dollars,Claim
they have been shortchanged,Claim
we have taken ten million taxpayers off the tax rolls in the last eight years,Premise
we have uh  added to the minimum tax uh  provision to make all people pay more taxes,Premise
i believe in tax equity for the middleincome taxpayer increasing the personal exemption,Claim
mr carter wants to increase taxes for roughly half of the taxpayers of this country,Premise
the governor has also played a little fast and loose with the facts about vetoes,Claim
the records show that president roosevelt vetoed an average of fiftyfive bills a year,Premise
president truman vetoed on the average while he was president about thirtyeight bills a year,Premise
i understand that governor carter when he was governor of georgia vetoed between thirtyfive and forty bills a year,Premise
my average in two years is twentysix,Premise
in the process of that we have saved uhh  9 billion,Claim
i think the feeling is misplaced,Claim
there is a considerable antiwashington feeling throughout the country,Premise
in the last two years we have restored integrity in the white house,Premise
weve set high standards in the executive branch of the government,Premise
the antiwashington feeling in my opinion ought to be focused on the congress of the united states,Claim
for example this congress very shortly will spend a billion dollars a year for its housekeeping its salaries its expenses and the like,Premise
the next congress will probably be the first billiondollar congress in the history of the united states,Premise
i dont think the american people are getting their moneys worth from the majority party that run this congress,Claim
we in addition see that uh  in the last uh  four years the number of employees hired by the congress has gone up substantial uh much more than uh  the gross national product much more than any other increase throughout our society,Premise
i dont see any improvement in the performance of the congress under the present leadership,Claim
congress is hiring people by the droves and the cast as a result has gone up,Premise
it seems to me instead of the antiwashington feeling being aimed at everybody in washington it seems to me that the focus should be where the problem is which is the congress of the united states and particularly the majority in the congress,Claim
they spend too much money on themselves,Premise
they have too many employees,Premise
theres some question about their morality,Premise
thats where the problem is,Claim
in this election the focus should not be on the executive branch but the corrections should come as the voters vote for their members of the house of representatives or for their united states senator,Claim
it seems to me that uh  we have a chance  the republicans  to get a majority in the house of representatives,Claim
we will make some gains in the united states senate,Premise
so there will be different ratios in the house as well as in the senate,Premise
as president i will be able to uh  work with that congress,Claim
i think it would be contrary to one of the basic concepts in our system of government  a system of checks and balances,Claim
i think the american people want a republican president to check on any excesses that come out of the next congress,Claim
if it is a democratic congress,Premise
we will have in my judgment greater deficits with more spending more dangers of inflation,Claim
if we have a democratic congress next year and a president who wants to spend an additional one hundred billion dollars a year or maybe two hundred billion dollars a year with more programs,Premise
we have a democratic congress today and fortunately weve had a republican president to check their excesses with my vetoes,Premise
supposing we had  had a democratic congress for the last two years and wed had uh  governor carter as president,Premise
he has in effect said that he would agree with all of  he would disapprove of the vetoes that i have made and would have added significantly to expenditures and the deficit in the federal government,Premise
its not a matter of uh  republican and democrat,Claim
its a matter of leadership or no leadership,Claim
president eisenhower worked with a democratic congress very well,Premise
even president nixon because he was a strong leader at least worked with a democratic congress very well,Premise
this is government by stalemate,Claim
mr ford has vetoed as i said earlier four times as many bills per year as mr nixon,Premise
mr ford quite often puts forward a program just as a public relations stunt and never tries to put it through the congress by working with the congress,Premise
i think under presidents for uh  nixon and eisenhower they passed about 60 to 75 percent of their legislation,Premise
this year mr ford will not pass more than 26 percent of all the legislative proposals he puts forward,Premise
weve seen almost a complete breakdown in the proper relationship between the president who represents this country and the congress who collectively also represent this country,Premise
i think its only fair that he be responsible for the nixon administration in its entirety of which he was a part,Claim
i dont think its uh  the congress is mr fords opponent,Claim
weve had uh  republican presidents before whove tried to run against a democratic  uh congress,Premise
if he insists that uh  that i be responsible for the democratic congress of which im  have not been a part,Premise
that i think is a good balance,Claim
a president ought to lead this country,Premise
mr ford so far as i know except for avoiding another watergate has not accomplished one single major program for this country,Claim
theres been a constant squabbling between the president and the congress,Premise
thats not the way this country ought to be run,Premise
mr ford has uh  misquoted an ap uh  news story that was in error to begin with,Claim
that story reported several times that i would lower taxes for low and middleincome families and uh  that correction was delivered to the white house,Premise
i am sure that the president knows about this uh  correction but he still insists uh  on repeating an erroneous statement,Claim
the president ought to have a chance to appoint a chairman of the federal reserve board to have a coterminous uh term,Claim
in other words both of em serve the same four  four years,Claim
i think that mr uh  burns did take a typical erroneous republican attitude in the 1973 year when inflation was so high,Claim
they assumed that the uh  inflation rate was because of excessive demand and uh  therefore put into effect tight constraint on the economy,Premise
very high interest rates which is typical also of the republican administration uh  tried to increase the uh  the tax uh  payments by individuals and cut the tax payments by corporations,Premise
i would have uh  done it opposite,Claim
i think the uh  problem shouldve been addressed by increasing productivity by having uh  put  put people back to work so they could purchase more goods lower income taxes on individuals perhaps raise them if necessary on corporations in comparison,Claim
mr burns uh  in that respect made a very serious mistake,Claim
i would not wanna destroy the  the independence of the uh federal reserve  uh board,Claim
i do think we ought to have a cohesive economic policy with at  at least the chairman of the federal reserve board and the presidents terms being uh  the same and letting the congress of course be the third uh  entity with uh  with independence subject only to the presidents veto,Claim
we have had a responsible monetary policy,Claim
the chairman of the federal reserve board should be independent,Premise
fortunately he has been during democratic as well as republican administrations,Premise
the federal reserve board indicated that the supply of money would be held between four to four and a half and seven and seven and a half,Premise
they have done a good job in integrating the money supply with the uh  fiscal policy of the uh  executive and legislative branches of the government,Claim
it would be catastrophic if the chairman of the federal reserve board became the tool of the political uh  party that was in power,Premise
its important for our future uhh  economic security that that job be nonpolitical and uh  separate from the executive and the legislative branches,Claim
the real problem with the fbi and in fact all of the intelligence agencies is there are no real laws governing them,Claim
such laws as there are tend to be vague and openended,Premise
leaving these agencies to executive discretion and direction can get them and in fact the country in a great deal of trouble,Claim
one president may be a decent man the next one might not be,Premise
i think uh  weve tightened it up,Claim
weve uh  straightened out their problems that developed over the last few years,Claim
it doesnt seem to me that its needed or necessary to have legislation in this particular regard,Claim
i am the first president in thirty years who has reorganized the intelligence agencies in the federal government the cia the defense intelligence agency the national security agency and the others,Premise
weve done that by executive order,Premise
i have recommended to the congress however  im sure youre familiar with this  legislation that would uhh  make it uhh  very uhh  proper in  in the right way that the attorney general could go in and get the right for wiretapping under security cases,Premise
this was an effort that was made by the attorney general and myself working with the congress,Premise
even in this area where i think new legislation would be justified uh the congress has not responded,Premise
i feel in that case as well as in the reorganization of the intelligence agencies as ive done we have to do it by executive order,Claim
we have good executive orders,Claim
im glad that we have a good director in george bush,Premise
the cia and the dia and nasa uh  uh  nsa are now doing a good job under proper supervision,Premise
there has been too much government secrecy and not uh  not enough respect for the personal privacy of american citizens,Claim
i think its time to talk about the future,Claim
our nation in the last eight years has been divided as never before,Premise
its a time for unity,Claim
its a time to draw ourselves together,Claim
have a president and a congress that can work together with mutual respect for a change cooperating for a change in the open for a change so the people can understand their own government,Premise
its time for government industry labor manufacturing agriculture education other entities in our society to cooperate,Claim
its a time for government to understand and to cooperate with our people,Claim
for a long time our american citizens have been excluded sometimes misled sometimes have been lied to,Premise
this is uh  not compatible with the purpose of our nation,Claim
it needs to be competent,Claim
the government needs to be wellmanaged efficient economical,Claim
we need to have a government thats sensitive to our peoples needs,Claim
to those who are poor who dont have adequate health care who have been cheated too long with our tax programs whove been out of jobs whose families have been torn apart,Premise
we need to restore the faith and the trust of the american people in their own government,Claim
weve suffered,Claim
we havent had leadership in this administration,Premise
weve got a government of stalemate,Claim
our economic strength is still there,Claim

his tax cut plan for example raises the question of whether its the right choice for the country,Claim
under governor bushs tax cut proposal he would spend more money on tax cuts for the wealthiest 1 than all of the new spending that he proposes for education health care prescription drugs and national defense all combined,Premise
i think those are the wrong priorities,Claim
under my proposal for every dollar that i propose in spending for things like education and health care i will put another dollar into middle class tax cuts,Claim
for every dollar that i spend in those two categories ill put 2 toward paying down the national debt,Claim
i think its very important to keep the debt going down and completely eliminate it,Claim
i also think its very important to go to the next stage of welfare reform,Claim
our country has cut the welfare rolls in half,Premise
i fought hard from my days in the senate and as vice president to cut the welfare rolls,Claim
weve moved millions of people in america into good jobs,Premise
its now time for the next stage of welfare reform and include fathers and not only mothers,Premise
my opponent thinks the government  the surplus is the governments money,Claim
thats not what i think,Claim
i think its the hardworking people of americas money,Claim
i want to share some of that money with,Claim
so you have more money to build and save and dream for your families,Premise
there is a difference of opinion,Claim
its a difference of opinion,Claim
its a difference between government making decisions for you and you getting more of your money to make decisions for yourself,Premise
surely we can afford 5 of the 25 trillion that are coming into the treasury to the hard working people that pay the bills,Premise
my plan say why dont we pass 13 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills,Premise
over the next ten years it is going to be 25 trillion of revenue that comes into our treasurey and we anticipate spending 21 trillion,Premise
yes,Claim
i take him for his word,Claim
i fully recognize im not of washington,Premise
im from texas,Premise
hes got a lot of experience but so do i,Claim
ive been the chief executive officer of the second biggest state in the union,Premise
i have a proud record of working with both republicans and democrats which is what our nation needs,Premise
somebody that can come to washington and say lets forget all the finger pointing and get positive things done on medicare prescription drugs social security,Premise
i take him for his word,Claim
tonight were going to hear some phony numbers about what i think and what we ought to do,Claim
if you look at the plan and add the numbers up,Premise
these numbers are correct,Claim
he spends more money for tax cuts for the wealthiest 1 than all of his new spending proposals for health care prescription drugs education and national defense all combined,Premise
i agree that the surplus is the american peoples money,Premise
its your money,Premise
i dont think we should give nearly half of it to the wealthiest 1,Claim
the other 99 have had an awful lot to do with building the surplus in our prosperity,Premise
they cant get it done,Claim
eight years ago they campaigned on prescription drugs for seniors,Premise
four years ago they campaigned on getting prescription drugs for seniors,Premise
now theyre campaigning on getting prescription drugs for seniors,Premise
theres been some missed opportunities,Claim
its time to get somebody in washington who is going to work with both republicans and democrats to get some positive things done when it comes to our seniors,Claim
theyve had a chance,Premise
theyve had a chance to form consensus,Premise
i think there was a good opportunity to bring republicans and democrats together to reform the social security system so seniors will never go without,Claim
ive got a plan on medicare,Claim
were going to give you additional choices like they give federal employees in the federal employee health plan,Claim
for example thats a twostage plan that says well have immediate help for seniors and what i call immediate helping hand a 48 billion program,Premise
they have a variety of choices to choose so should seniors,Premise
as opposed to politicizing an issue like medicare in other words holding it up as an issue hoping somebody bites it and try to clobber them over the head with it for political purposes this year in the year 2000 its time to get it done once and for all,Claim
same with social security,Claim
there are a lot of young workers at our rallies we go to that when they hear ill trust them at their option to be able to manage under certain guidelines some of their own money to get a better rate of return so that theyll have a retirement plan in the future they begin to nod their heads and they want a different attitude in washington,Premise
those on social security today will have their promise made but also to give younger workers the option at their choice of being able to manage some of their own money in the private sector to make sure theres a social security system around tomorrow,Claim
under my plan all seniors will get prescription drugs under medicare,Claim
its not,Claim
under the medicare prescription drug proposal im making here is how it works you go to your own doctor,Premise
your doctor chooses your prescription,Premise
no hmo or insurance company can take those choices away from you,Premise
then you go to your own pharmacy,Premise
you fill the prescription and medicare pays half the cost,Premise
if youre in a very poor family or if you have very high costs medicare will pay all the costs a 25 premium and much better benefits than you can possibly find in the private sector,Claim
95 of all seniors would get no help whatsoever under my opponents plan for the first four or five years,Claim
the man is running on mediscare,Claim
trying to frighten people in the voting booth,Premise
its just not the way i think and its not my intentions and not my plan,Claim
i want all seniors to have prescription drugs in medicare,Claim
my plan not only trusts seniors with options my plan sets aside 34 trillion for medicare over the next ten years,Claim
i believe we ought to give seniors more options,Claim
i believe we ought to make the system work better,Claim
seniors will have not only a medicare plan where the poor seniors will have prescription drugs paid for but there will be a variety of options,Claim
thereâ€™s been opportunity to do so but this administration has failed to do it,Claim
we need to reform medicare,Claim
the current system today has meant a lot for a lot of seniors,Premise
i really appreciate the intentions of the current system as i mentioned,Premise
there are a lot of procedures that havent kept up in medicare with the current times,Premise
no prescription drug benefits,Premise
no drug therapy,Premise
no preventative medicines,Premise
no vision care,Premise
we need to have a modern system to help seniors,Claim
the idea of supporting a federally controlled 132000page document bureaucracy as being a compassionate way for seniors and the only compassionate source of care for seniors is not my vision,Premise
youve had your chance vice president,Claim
youve been there for eight years and nothing has been done,Premise
i know it will require a different kind of leader to go to washington to say to both republicans and democrats lets come together,Claim
my plan also says it requires a new approach in washington dc,Claim
its going to require somebody who can work across the partisan divide,Premise
under my plan i will put medicare in an iron clad lockbox and prevent the money from being used for anything other than medicare,Claim
the governor has declined to endorse that idea even though the republican as well as democratic leaders in congress have endorsed it,Premise
i donâ€™t think he will,Claim
under his plan if you work out the numbers â 100 billion comes out of medicare just for the wealthiest 1 in the tax cut,Premise
under the governors plan your premiums would go up by between 18 and 47,Claim
if you kept the same fee for service that you have now under medicare,Premise
that is the study of the congressional plan that hes modeled his proposal on by the medicare actuaries,Premise
under my plan half of their costs would be paid right away,Claim
under governor bushs plan they would get not one penny for four to five years and then they would be forced to go into an hmo or to an insurance company and ask them for coverage but there would be no limit on the premiums or the deductibles or any of the terms and conditions,Claim
let me give you one quick example,Premise
there is a man here tonight named george mckinney from milwaukee,Premise
his wife has heart trouble,Premise
hes 70 years old has high blood pressure,Premise
they have an income of 25000 a year,Premise
they cant pay for their prescription drugs and so theyre some of the ones that go to canada regularly in order to get their prescription drugs,Premise
under my plan the man gets immediate help with prescription drugs,Claim
its called immediate helping hand,Premise
instead of squabbling and finger pointing he gets immediate help,Premise
they get 25000 a year income that makes them ineligible,Claim
the federal government should take no more than a third of anybodys check,Claim
under my tax plan that he continues to criticize i set onethird,Premise
hes trying to scare people in the voting booth,Claim
this is a man who has great numbers,Premise
he talks about numbers,Premise
im beginning to think not only did he invent the internet but he invented the calculator,Premise
its fuzzy math,Premise
i also dropped the bottom rate from 15 to 10,Claim
by far the vast majority of the help goes to people at the bottom end of the economic ladder,Premise
if youre a family of four in massachusetts making 50000 you get a 50 cut in the federal income taxes you pay,Premise
its from 4000 to about 2000,Premise
the difference in our plans is i want that 2000 to go to you,Claim
the vice president would like to be spending the 2000 on your behalf,Claim
its just clear you can go to the website and look,Premise
if you make more than 25000 a year you dont get a penny of help under the bush prescription drug proposal for at least four to five years,Claim
then youre pushed into a medicare  into an hmo or insurance company plan and theres no limit on the premiums or the deductibles or any of the conditions,Claim
the insurance companies say it wont work and they wont offer these plans,Premise
the difference is i want to bring it to 100 and he wants to bring it to 5,Claim
thats totally false for him to stand up here and say that,Claim
they have had their chance to get something done,Claim
im going to work with democrats and republicans to reform the system,Claim
all seniors will be covered,Claim
all poor seniors will have their prescription drugs paid for,Claim
in the meantime well have a plan to help poor seniors and in the meantime it could be one year or two years,Claim
he said all poor seniors,Premise
all seniors are covered under prescription drugs in my plan,Claim
if we can get it done in the first year,Premise
you bet,Claim
yours is phased in in eight years,Claim
its a twophase plan,Premise
for the first four years  it takes a year to pass it and for the first four years only the poor are covered,Premise
middle class seniors like george mckinney and his wife are not covered for four to five years,Premise
my plan has not only a shortterm component but also a longterm component,Claim
it focuses not only on increasing the supply which i think we have to do but also on working on the consumption side,Claim
in the shortterm we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price from opec when they want to raise the price,Premise
in the longterm we have to give new incentives for the development of domestic resources like deep gas in the western gulf like stripper wells for oil but also renewable sources of energy,Premise
domestic sources that are cleaner and better,Claim
im proposing a plan that will give tax credits and tax incentives for the rapid development of new kinds of cars and trucks and buses and factories and boilers and furnaces that dont have as much pollution that dont burn as much energy and that help us get out on the cutting edge of the new technologies that will create millions of new jobs,Claim
when we sell these new products here well then be able to sell them overseas,Premise
there is a ravenous demand for them overseas,Premise
i think that is the wrong choice,Claim
it would only give us a few months worth of oil and the oil wouldnt start flowing for many years into the future,Premise
i dont think its a fair price to pay to destroy precious parts of americas environment,Claim
we have to bet on the future and move beyond the current technologies,Claim
to have a whole new generation of more efficient cleaner energy technology,Premise
another big difference is governor bush is proposing to open up some of our most precious environmental treasures like the arctic national wildlife refuge for the big oil companies to go in and start producing oil there,Claim
its an issue i know a lot about,Claim
i was a small oil person for a while in west texas,Premise
the only way to become less dependent on foreign sources of crude oil is to explore at home,Claim
you bet i want to open up a small part of alaska,Claim
when that field is online it will produce one million barrels a day,Claim
today we import one million barrels from saddam hussein,Premise
i would rather that a million come from our own hemisphere our own country as opposed to saddam hussein,Premise
i want to build more pipelines to move natural gas throughout this hemisphere,Claim
i want to develop the coal resources in america,Claim
have clean coal technologies,Claim
weâ€™ve got abundant supplies of energy here in america,Premise
weâ€™d better get after it we better start exploring it,Claim
otherwise well be in deep trouble in the future,Claim
because of our dependency upon foreign sources of crude,Premise
this is an administration thats had no plan,Premise
all of a sudden the results of having no plan have caught up with america,Premise
we have to fully fund liheap which is a way to help low income folks particularly here in the east to pay for high fuel bills,Claim
we need an active exploration program in america,Claim
im for doing something both on the supply side and production side and on the consumption side,Claim
i found one thing in governor bushs answer that we certainly agree on and thats the low income heating assistance program,Claim
i worked to get 400 million just a couple of weeks ago,Premise
and to establish a permanent home heating oil reserve here in the northeast,Premise
i think we need to get serious about this energy crisis both in the congress and in the white house,Claim
as for the proposals that ive worked for for renewables and conservation and efficiencies and new technologies,Premise
the fact is for the last few years in the congress weve faced a lot of opposition to them,Premise
theyve only approved about 10 of the agenda ive helped to send up there,Premise
if you entrust me with the presidency,Premise
i will tackle this problem and focus on new technologies that will make us less dependent on big oil or foreign oil,Claim
he should have been tackling it for the last seven years,Premise
the difference is we need to explore at home,Claim
the vice president doesnt believe in exploration in alaska,Claim
theres a lot of shutin gas that we need to be moving out of alaska by pipeline,Premise
theres an interesting issue up in the northwest as well,Premise
im against removing dams in the northwest,Claim
i donâ€™t know where the vice president stands but thatâ€™s a renewable energy source of energy,Premise
we need to keep that in line,Claim
i know we can do a better job of clean coal technologies,Claim
i was in coal country in west virginia yesterday,Premise
there is an abundant supply of coal in america,Premise
im going to ask the congress for 2 billion to make sure we have the cleanest coal technologies in the world,Claim
in the shortterm we need to get after it here in america,Claim
we need to explore our resources,Claim
we need to develop our reservoirs of domestic production,Claim
we also need to have a hemispheric energy policy where canada mexico and the united states come together,Claim
i brought this up recently with vincent fox the newly elected president in mexico hes a man i know from mexico,Premise
i talked to him about how best to expedite the exploration of natural gas in mexico and transport it up to the united states so we become less dependent on foreign sources of crude oil,Premise
its time for a new administration to deal with the energy problem,Claim
this is a major problem facing america,Premise
the administration did not deal with it,Premise
i strongly support new investments in clean coal technology,Claim
i made a proposal three months ago on this,Premise
also domestic exploration yes,Claim
but not in the environmental treasures of our country,Claim
we dont have to do that,Claim
thats the wrong choice,Claim
it is not the right thing for the future,Claim
its the right thing for the consumers,Claim
less dependency upon foreign sources of crude is good for consumers,Claim
we can do so in an environmentally friendly way,Claim
i was disappointed in the ruling,Claim
abortions ought to be more rare in america,Premise
im worried that that pill will create more abortions and cause more people to have abortions,Premise
this is a very important topic and its a very sensitive topic,Claim
a lot of good people disagree on the issue,Premise
i think what the next president ought to do is to promote a culture of life in america,Claim
life of the elderly and life of those living all across the country,Claim
life of the unborn,Claim
i think a noble goal for this country is that every child born or unborn need to be protected by law and welcomed to life,Claim
what i do believe is that we can find good common ground on issues of parental consent or parental notification,Claim
we need to ban partial birth abortions,Claim
we need to change a lot of minds before we get there in america,Premise
i believe banning partial birth abortions would be a positive step to reducing the number of abortions in america,Claim
this is an issue that will require a new attitude,Claim
weve been battling over abortion for a long period of time,Premise
surely this nation can come together to promote the value of life,Claim
surely we can fight off these laws that will encourage doctors to  to allow doctors to take the lives of our seniors,Claim
surely we can work together to create a cultural life so some of these youngsters who feel like they can take a neighbors life with a gun will understand that thats not the way america is meant to be,Claim
surely we can find common ground to reduce the number of abortions in america,Claim
i do support that decision,Claim
the fda took 12 years,Premise
they determined it was medically safe for the women who use that drug,Premise
i would sign a law banning that procedure provided that doctors have the ability to save a womans life or to act if her health is severely at risk,Claim
thats not the main issue,Claim
the main issue is whether or not the roe v wade decision is going to be overturned,Claim
i support a womans right to choose,Claim
my opponent does not,Claim
it is important,Claim
the next president is going to appoint three and maybe even four justices of the supreme court,Premise
governor bush has declared to the antichoice groups that he will appoint justices in the mold of scalia and clarence thomas who are known for being the most vigorous opponents of a womans right to choose,Premise
he trusts the government to order a woman to do what it thinks she ought to do,Claim
i trust women to make the decisions that affect their lives their destinies and their bodies,Claim
i think a womans right to choose ought to be protected and defended,Claim
i just think that we ought to support the decision,Claim
i am prolife,Claim
i have no litmus test on that issue or any other issue,Claim
ill put competent judges on the bench,Claim
people who will strictly interpret the constitution and not use the bench to write social policy,Premise
i believe that the judges ought not to take the place of the legislative branch of government,Claim
that theyre appointed for life and that they ought to look at the constitution as sacred,Premise
they shouldnt misuse their bench,Premise
that is going to be a big difference between my opponent and me,Claim
i dont believe in liberal activist judges,Claim
i believe in strict constructionists,Claim
those are the kind of judges i will appoint,Claim
ive named four supreme court justices in the state of texas and would ask the people to check out their qualifications their deliberations,Premise
theyre good solid men and women who have made good sound judgments on behalf of the people of texas,Premise
in my view the constitution ought to be interpreted as a document that grows with our country and our history,Claim
i would appoint people that have a philosophy that i think would have it quite likely they would uphold roe v wade,Claim
when the phrase a strict constructionist is used and when the names of scalia and thomas are used as the benchmarks for who would be appointed those are code words and nobody should mistake this for saying the governor would appoint people who would overturn roe v wade,Premise
i believe for example that there is a right of privacy in the fourth amendment,Claim
we both use similar language to reach an exactly opposite outcome,Claim
i dont favor a litmus test but i know that there are ways to assess how a potential justice interprets the constitution,Premise
it sounds like the vice presidentâ€™s not right very many times tonight,Claim
i just told you the criteria on which ill appoint judges,Premise
i have a record of appointing judges in the state of texas,Premise
thats what a governor gets to do,Premise
a governor gets to name supreme court judges,Premise
he also reads all kinds of things into my tax plan and into my medicare plan,Premise
i do believe its wrong to use a litmus test,Claim
it would be likely that they would uphold roe v wade,Claim
you can get a pretty good idea of how theyll interpret questions,Claim
if you look at the history of a lower court judges rulings,Premise
a lot of questions are first impression,Premise
these questions that have been seen many times come up in a new context,Premise
this is a very important issue,Claim
a lot of young women in this country take this right for granted and it could be lost,Premise
t is on the ballot in this election make no mistake about it,Premise
hell put liberal activists justices who will use their bench to subvert the legislature,Claim
thats what hell do,Claim
thatâ€™s not right,Claim
i think we should support the people of serbia and yugoslavia as they call the serbia plus montenegro and put pressure in every way possible to recognize the lawful outcome of the election,Claim
milosevic has lost the election,Premise
his opponent kostunica has won the election,Premise
its overwhelming,Premise
milosevics government refuses to release the vote count,Premise
theres now a general strike going on,Premise
theyre demonstrating,Premise
the people of serbia have acted very bravely in kicking this guy out of office,Premise
now he is trying to not release the votes and then go straight to a socalled runoff election without even announcing the results of the first vote,Premise
that is a very strong incentive that weve given them to do the right thing,Claim
weve made it clear along with our allies that when milosevic leaves then serbia will be able to have a more normal relationship with the rest of the world,Premise
he should be held accountable for his actions,Claim
milosevic has been indicted as a war criminal,Premise
we have to take measured steps,Claim
the sentiment within serbia is for understandable reasons against the united states,Claim
their nationalism  even if they dont like milosevic they still have some feelings lingering from the nato action there,Premise
we have to be intelligent in the way we go about it,Claim
we should do everything we can to see that the will of the serbian people expressed in this extraordinary election is done,Claim
its time for the man to go,Claim
the united states must have a strong diplomatic hand with our friends in nato,Premise
its time for the man to leave,Claim
its important to make sure our alliances are as strong as they possibly can be to keep the pressure on mr milosevic,Claim
this will be an interesting moment for the russians to step up and lead as well,Claim
be a wonderful time for the russians to step into the balkans and convince mr milosevic that its in his best interest and his countrys best interest to leave office,Claim
the russians have a lot of sway in that part of the world,Premise
we would like to see the russians use that sway to encourage democracy to take hold,Premise
its an encouraging election,Premise
in this particular situation no,Claim
we have a lot of sanctions in force against serbia right now,Premise
the people of serbia know that they can escape all those sanctions if this guy is turned out of power,Premise
i think thats the wrong thing,Claim
i think the governors instinct is not necessarily bad,Claim
we have worked with the russians in a constructive way in kosovo for example to end the conflict there,Premise
i think we need to be very careful in the present situation before we invite the russians to play the lead role in mediating,Claim
we wouldnt use the russians,Claim
if they didnt agree with our answer,Premise
they donâ€™t,Premise
i wouldnt use force,Claim
i wouldnt use force,Claim
no,Claim
they have not yet been willing to recognize kostunica as the lawful winner of the election,Premise
im not sure its right for us to invite the president of russia to mediate this  this dispute there,Claim
we might not like the results that comes out of that,Premise
they currently favor going forward with a runoff election,Premise
its not in our national interest to use force in this case,Claim
i would use pressure and diplomacy,Claim
its up to the people in this region to take control of their country,Premise
there is a difference with what the president did in kosovo which i supported and this,Premise
if its in our vital national interests and that means whether our territory is threatened or people could be harmed whether or not the alliances are  our defense alliances are threatened whether or not our friends in the middle east are threatened,Premise
that would be a time to seriously consider the use of force,Claim
whether or not the mission was clear,Claim
whether or not it was a clear understanding as to what the mission would be,Claim
whether or not we were prepared and trained to win,Claim
whether or not our forces were of high morale and high standing and wellequipped,Claim
whether or not there was an exit strategy,Claim
i would take the use of force very seriously,Claim
i would be guarded in my approach,Claim
i dont think we can be all things to all people in the world,Claim
i think weve got to be very careful when we commit our troops,Claim
i believe the role of the military is to fight and win war and therefore prevent war from happening in the first place,Claim
i would take my responsibility seriously,Claim
the vice president and i have a disagreement about the use of troops,Claim
he believes in nation building,Premise
i would be very careful about using our troops as nation builders,Premise
it starts with making sure we rebuild our military power,Claim
morale in todays military is too low,Premise
were having trouble meeting recruiting goals,Premise
we met the goals this year but in the previous years we have not met recruiting goals,Premise
some of our troops are not wellequipped,Premise
i believe were overextended in too many places,Claim
i want to rebuild the military power,Claim
the mission is to fight and win war and therefore prevent war from happening in the first place,Claim
it starts with a billion dollar pay raise for the men and women who wear the uniform,Claim
its to make sure our troops are wellhoused and wellequipped,Premise
bonus plans to keep some of our highskilled folks in the services and a commander in chief who clearly sets the mission,Premise
i will do whatever is necessary in order to make sure our forces stay the strongest in the world,Claim

our military is the strongest besttrained bestequipped bestled fighting force in the world and in the history of the world,Claim
in my tenyear budget proposal ive set aside more than twice as much for this purpose as governor bush has in his proposal,Claim
we should get involved,Claim
if our national security is at stake,Premise
if we have allies,Premise
if weve tried every other course,Premise
if were sure military action will succeed,Premise
if the costs are proportionate to the benefits,Premise
just because we dont want to get involved everywhere doesnt mean we should back off anywhere it comes up,Claim
i think that there are situations like in bosnia or kosovo where theres a genocide where our national security is at stake there,Claim
i agree our military is the strongest in the world today,Claim
thats not the question,Claim
the question is will it be the strongest in the years to come,Claim
the warning signs are real,Premise
everywhere i go on the campaign trail i see moms and dads whose son or daughter may wear the uniform and they tell me about how discouraged their son or daughter may be,Premise
a recent poll was taken among 1000 enlisted personnel as well as officers over half of whom will leave the service when their time of enlistment is up,Premise
the captains are leaving the service,Premise
there is a problem,Claim
its going to require a new commander in chief to rebuild the military power,Claim
the other day i was honored to be flanked by colin powell and general norman schwartzkopf recently stood by me side and agreed with me,Premise
they said even if we are the strongest if we donâ€™t do something if we dont have a clear vision of the military if we dont stop extending our troops all around the world and nation building missions then were going to have a serious problem coming down the road and im going to prevent that,Premise
im going to rebuild our military power,Claim
its one of the major priorities of my administration,Claim
they should look at our proposals and look at us as people and make up their own minds,Claim

whether or not one makes decisions based on sound principles,Claim
whether or not you rely upon polls and focus groups on how to decide what the course of action is,Claim
we have too much polling and focus groups going on in washington today,Claim

for every dollar that i propose to spend on education he spends 5 on a tax cut for the wealthiest 1,Premise
those are very clear differences,Claim
the man is practicing fuzzy math again,Claim
theres differences,Claim
under vice president gores plan he is going to grow the federal government in the largest increase since lyndon baines johnson in 1965,Premise
were talking about a massive government,Premise
were talking about adding to or increasing 200 programs 20000 new bureaucrats,Premise
imagine how many irs agents it is going to take to be able to figure out his targeted tax cut for the middle class that excludes 50 million americans,Premise
there is a huge difference in this campaign,Claim
he says hes going to give you tax cuts,Premise
50 million of you wont receive it,Claim
he said in his speech he wants to make sure the right people get tax relief,Premise
thats not the role of a president to decide right and wrong,Claim
everybody who pays taxes ought to get tax relief,Claim
after my plan is in place the wealthiest americans will pay a higher percentage of taxes then they do today,Claim
the poorest of americans six million families wont pay any tax at all,Claim
its a huge difference,Claim
a difference between big exploding federal government that wants to think on your behalf and a plan that meets priorities and liberates working people to be able to make decisions on your own,Premise
you havent heard the governor deny these numbers,Premise
hes called them phony and fuzzy,Premise
the fact remains almost 30 of his proposed tax cut goes to  only to americans that make more than 1 million per year,Claim
the facts are after my plan the wealthiest of americans pay more taxes of the percentage of the whole than they do today,Claim
if youre a family of four making 50000 in massachusetts you get a 50 tax cut,Claim
the strunk family in allentown pennsylvania i campaigned with them the other day,Premise
they make 51000 combined income they pay about 3500 in taxes,Premise
under my plan they get 1800 of tax relief,Premise

he would rather spend the familys 1800 and i would rather the strunks spend their own money,Claim
no i dont,Claim
im not going to go to calling names on his facts,Claim
im just gonna tell you what the real facts are,Claim
the analysis that hes talking about leaves out more than half of the tax cuts that i have proposed,Claim
if you just add the numbers up,Premise
he still hasnt denied it,Premise
he spends more money on a tax cut for the wealthiest 1 than all his new proposals for prescription drugs healthcare education and national defense combined,Claim
those are the wrong priorities,Claim
every middle class family is eligible for a tax cut under my proposal,Premise
665 billion over ten years for the wealthiest 1,Premise
almost 30 of it goes to americans that make more than 1 million per year,Premise
i believe college tuition up to 10000 per year ought to be tax deductible so middleclass families can choose to send their children to college,Claim
i believe all senior citizens should be able to choose their own doctors and get prescription drugs from their own pharmacists with medicare paying half the bill,Claim
i believe parents ought to be able to make more choices need more public and charter school choice to send their kids always to a safe school,Claim
we need to make education the number one priority in our country and treat teachers like the professionals that they are,Claim
i have made it a number one priority in my budget not a tax cut for the wealthy,Claim
this is a man whose plan excludes 50 million americans,Claim
not so,Claim
its a fundamental difference of opinion,Claim
take for example the marriage penalty,Premise
if you itemize your tax return you get no marriage penalty relief,Premise

he decides who the right people are,Premise
well spend 25 trillion  well collect 25 trillion in revenue in the next 10 years and spend 21 trillion,Premise

that is not right,Claim
if youre a single mother making 22000 a year and you have two children under this tax code for every additional dollar you make you pay a higher marginal rate on that dollar than someone making more than 200000 a year,Premise
my plan drops the rate from 15 to 10 and increases the child credit from 500 to 1000 to make the code more fair for everybody not just a few not just a handful,Premise
everybody who pays taxes ought to get some relief,Claim
we can make a huge difference by saying if you receive federal money we expect you to show results,Claim

here are the key ingredients high expectations strong accountabily,Claim
thats my vision for public education all around america,Claim
what michael says dont put all these rules on us just let us teach and hold us accountable for every grade thats what we do,Premise
as a result these mainly hispanic youngsters are some of the best learners in houston texas,Premise
here is the role of the federal government,Claim
one is to change head start to a reading program,Claim
two is to say if you want to access reading money you can do so,Claim
we have to consolidate the federal programs to free districts to free the schools and encourage innovators like michael,Claim

let them reach out beyond the confines of the current structure to recruit teachforthechildren type teachers,Premise
show us if they are learning to read write add and subtract and if so there will be bonus plans,Claim

i do have mandatory testing,Claim
i think the governor may not have heard what i said clearly,Claim
the voluntary national testing is in addition to the mandatory testing that we require of states,Premise
which goes a step farther than governor bush has been willing to go,Claim
all schools all school districts students themselves and required teacher testing,Premise
i dont think private schools should have a right to take taxpayer money away from public schools at a time when caley ellis is standing in that classroom,Claim

the way governor jim hunt does in north carolina,Premise
the governor if its a failing school would leave the children in that failing school for three years and then give a little bit of money to the parents a down payment on a down payment for private school tuition and pretend that that would be enough for them to go out and go to a private school,Premise
its an illusion,Claim

i didnt say that,Claim
you need to test every year,Claim
thats how you determine if children are progressing to excellence,Premise
well make sure you do early before its too late,Claim
if you dont know what youre supposed to know,Premise
one of the things that we have to be careful about in politics is throwing money at a system that has not yet been reformed,Claim
more money is needed and i spend more money but step one is to make sure we reform the system to have the system in place that leaves no child behind,Premise

when the action in kosovo was dragging on and we were searching for a solution to the problem our country had defeated the adversary on the battlefield without a single american life being lost in combat,Premise
the dictator milosevic was hanging on,Premise
i invited the former prime minister of russia to my house and took a risk in asking him to get personally involved along with the head of finland to go to belgrade and to take a set of proposals from the united states that would constitute basically a surrender by serbia,Premise
i cast my lot with the people even when it means that you have to stand up to some powerful interests who are trying to turn the  the policies and the laws to their advantage,Claim

it broke my heart to go to the flood scene in del rio where a fellow and his family got completely uprooted,Premise
they are often on the front line of catastrophic situations,Claim
the only thing i knew to do was to get aid as quickly as possible with state and federal help and to put my arms around the man and his family and cry with them,Premise
thats what governors do,Premise
what i would do first and foremost is i would get in touch with the federal reserve chairman alan greenspan to find out all the facts and all the circumstances,Claim
i would have my secretary of the treasury be in touch with the financial centers not only here but at home,Claim
i would make sure that key members of congress were called in to discuss the gravity of the situation,Claim

when the asian financial crisis raised the risk of worldwide recession that could affect our economy,Premise
and now of course the euros value has been dropping but seems to be under control,Premise
it started for me in the last eight years when i had the honor of casting the tiebreaking vote to end the old economic plan here at home and put into place a new economic plan that has helped us to make some progress 22 million new jobs the greatest prosperity ever,Premise
theres no difference on that,Claim
there is a difference though as to what the economy has meant,Claim
i think the economy has meant more for the gore and clinton folks than the gore and clinton folks have meant for the economy,Claim
most of the economic growth that has taken place is a result of ingenuity and hard work and entrepreneurship and thats the role of goverment to encourage that,Premise
i think the american people deserve credit for the great economy that we have,Claim
its their ingenuity,Premise
they were working pretty hard eight years ago,Premise
they had ingenuity eight years ago,Premise
the difference is weve got a new policy,Claim
instead of concentrating on tax cuts mostly for the wealthy,Premise

i want to continue the prosperity and make sure that it enriches not just a few but all of our families,Claim
we have got to do much more,Claim
its not good enough,Claim
too many people have been left behind,Premise
instead of a high unemployment we have the lowest africanamerican and latin american unemployment rates in history and 22 million new jobs,Premise
we have gone from a tripledip recession during the previous 12 years to a tripling of the stock market,Premise
we have gone from the biggest deficits to the biggest surpluses,Premise
the key is job training education investments in health care and education environment retirement security,Premise
we have got to preserve social security,Premise
im totally opposed to diverting one out of every six dollars out of the social security trust fund as the governor has proposed into the stock market,Claim
i want new incentives for savings and investment for the young couples who are working hard so they can save and invest on their own on top of social security not at the expense of social security as the governor proposes,Claim
theyve had their chance to deliver a tax cut to you,Claim
a lot of folks are still waiting for that 1992 middleclass tax cut,Premise
i remember the vice president saying just give us a chance to get up there were going to make sure you get tax cuts,Premise
it didnt happen,Premise
now hes having to say that again,Premise
the surest way to bust this economy is to increase the role and size of the federal budget,Claim
the senate budget committee did a study of the vice presidents expenditures,Premise
its been projected that they could conceivably bust the budget by 900 billion,Premise
hell either have to raise your taxes by 900 billion or go into the social security surplus for 900 billion,Claim
this is a plan that is going to increase the bureaucracy by 20000 people,Premise
it is going to require numerous irs agents,Claim
his targeted tax cut is so detailed so much fine print,Premise
we need somebody to simplify the code,Claim

in the reinventing government program you just look at the numbers,Premise
it is 300000 people smaller today than it was eight years ago,Premise
having a 19 trillion tax cut almost half of which goes to the wealthy and a 1 trillion social security privatization proposal is the surest way to put our budget into deficit â€“ raise interest rates and put our prosperity at risk,Claim
it is 13 trillion mr vice president,Claim
it will go to everybody who pays taxes,Claim
im not going to be the kind of president that says you get tax relief and you dont,Claim
im not going to be a picker and chooser,Claim
what is fair is everybody who pays taxes ought to get relief,Premise
i do disagree,Claim
if we can keep our prosperity going if we can continue balancing the budget and paying down the debt then the strong economy keeps generating surpluses,Premise
i think that its very important to understand that cutting benefits under social security means that people like winifred skinner from des moines iowa who is here would really have a much harder time,Claim

i dont go along with it,Claim
i am opposed to it,Claim
im also opposed to a plan that diverts 1 out of every 6 away from the social security trust fund,Claim
i will keep social security in a lockbox and that pays down the national debt,Claim
the interest savings i would put right back into social security,Claim
that extends the life of social security for 55 years,Claim
social security is a trust fund that pays the checks this year with the money that is paid into social security this year,Premise
the governor wants to divert 1 out of every 6 off into the stock market,Premise
he would drain a trillion dollars out of the social security trust fund in this generation over the next ten years,Claim
social security under that approach would go bankrupt within this generation,Claim
his leading advisor on this plan actually said that would be okay because then the social security trust fund could start borrowing,Premise
it would borrow up to 3 trillion,Premise
social security has never done that,Premise
i dont think it should do that,Claim
i think it should stay in a lockbox,Claim

i want you to have your own asset that you can call your own,Claim
we want to allow younger workers to take some of their own money,Claim
he puts no real assets into the social security system,Premise
the revenues exceed the expenses in social security until the year 2015 which means all retirees are going to get the promises made,Premise
the money stays within the social security system,Premise
its a part of the social security system,Premise
he claims it will be out of social security,Premise
its your money,Claim
its a part of your retirement benefit,Premise
that you can pass on from one generation to the next,Claim
i want to get a better rate of return for your own money than the paltry 2 that the current social security trust gets today,Claim
theres a third way,Claim
that is to get a better rate of return on the social security monies coming into the trust,Premise
there is 23 trillion of surplus that we can use to make sure that younger workers have a social security plan in the future,Premise
if were smart,Premise
if we trust workers,Premise
if we understand the power of the compounding rate of interest,Premise
i give a new incentive for younger workers to save their own money and invest their own money but not at the expense of social security on top of social security,Claim
my plan is social security plus,Claim
the governors plan is social security minus,Claim
your future benefits would be cut by the amount thats diverted into the stock market,Premise
if you make bad investments thats too bad,Premise
even before then the problem hits because the money contributed to social security this year is an entitlement,Premise
thats how it works,Premise
the money is used to pay the benefits for seniors this year,Premise
if you cut the amount going in 1 out of every 6,Premise
you have to cut the value of each check by 1 out of every 6 unless you come up with the money from somewhere else,Claim
no,Claim
theres enough money to pay seniors today in the current affairs of social security,Premise
the trillion comes from the surplus,Premise
surplus is money  more money than needed,Premise
let me tell you what your plan is its not social security plus its social security plus huge debt,Claim
you leave future generations with tremendous ious,Claim
the issue is changing,Claim
seniors now understand that the promise made will be a promise kept but younger workers now understand we better have a government that trusts them,Premise
thats exactly what im going to do,Claim
its time to have a leader that doesnt put off tomorrow what we should do today,Claim
its time to have somebody to step up and say look lets let younger workers take some of their own money and under certain guidelines invest it in the private markets,Claim
the safest of federal investments yields 4,Premise
thats twice the amount of rate of return than the current social security trust,Premise
younger worker after younger worker hears my call that says i trust you,Premise
the trust fund goes bankrupt in this generation within 20 years,Claim
if you take it out of the surplus in the trust fund,Premise
when fdr established social security they didnt call them ious,Premise
they called it the full faith and credit of the united states,Premise
its not,Claim
we need to think differently about the issue,Claim
we need to make sure our seniors get the promise made,Claim
it will be impossible to bridge the gap without it,Claim
if we dont trust younger workers to manage some of their own money with the social security surplus,Premise
to grow from 1 trillion to 3 trillion,Premise
this is a government that thinks a 2 rate of return on your money is satisfactory,Premise
this is a government that says younger workers cant possibly have their own assets,Premise
what mr gores plan will do causing huge payroll taxes or major benefit reductions,Claim
i think the thing that discouraged me about the vice president was uttering those famous words no controlling legal authority,Claim

i know one thing about the position of president its the only position in our constitution that is filled by an individual who is given the responsibility to fight not just for one state or one district or the wellconnected or wealthy but to fight for all of the people including especially those who most need somebody who will stand up and take on whatever powerful forces might stand in the way,Premise
there is only one threat to peace and one threat to freedom  that that is presented by the international communist movement,Claim
since this campaign began i have had a very rare privilege,Premise
i have traveled to fortyeight of the fifty states and in my travels i have learned what the people of the united states are thinking about,Premise
there is one issue that stands out above all the rest one in which every american is concerned regardless of what group he may be a member and regardless of where he may live,Claim
that issue very simply stated is this how can we keep the peace  keep it without surrender how can we extend freedom  extend it without war,Claim
in determining how we deal with this issue we must find the answer to a very important but simple question who threatens the peace who threatens freedom in the world,Claim
if we are to have peace we must know how to deal with the communists and their leaders,Claim
i also have had the opportunity of knowing and meeting other communist leaders in the world,Premise
i know mr khrushchev,Premise
i believe there are certain principles we must find in dealing with him and his colleagues  principles if followed that will keep the peace and that also can extend freedom,Premise
we have to learn from the past,Claim
we cannot afford to make the mistakes of the past,Premise
in the seven years before this administration came into power in washington we found that six hundred million people went behind the iron curtain,Premise
at the end of that seven years we were engaged in a war in korea which cost of thirty thousand american lives,Premise
in the past seven years in president eisenhowers administration this situation has been reversed,Premise
we ended the korean war,Premise
by strong firm leadership we have kept out of other wars,Premise
we have avoided surrender of principle or territory at the conference table,Premise
i think therere several reasons,Claim
in the first place they made a fatal error in misjudging the communists,Claim
in trying to apply to them the same rules of conduct that you would apply to the leaders of the free world,Premise
one of the major errors they made was the one that led to the korean war,Claim
in ruling out the defense of korea they invited aggression in that area,Premise
they thought they were going to have peace  it brought war,Premise
we learned from their mistakes,Claim
in our seven years we find that we have been firm in our diplomacy,Premise
we have never made concessions without getting concessions in return,Premise
we have always been willing to go the extra mile to negotiate for disarmament or in any other area,Premise
we have never been willing to do anything that in effect surrendered freedom any place in the world,Premise
that is why president eisenhower was correct in not apologizing or expressing regrets to mr khrushchev at the paris conference as senator kennedy suggested he could have done,Claim
that is why senator wh president eisenhower was also correct in his policy in the formosa straits where he declined and refused to follow the recommendations recommendations with regard to  again  slicing off a piece of free territory and abandoning it if  in effect to the communists,Claim
recommendations which senator kennedy voted for in 1955 again made in 1959 again repeated in his debates that you have heard,Premise
this showed a lack of understanding of dictators a lack of understanding particularly of communists,Premise
every time you make such a concession it does not lead to peace,Claim
it only encourages them to blackmail you,Claim
it encourages them to begin a war,Claim
the record shows that we know how to keep the peace to keep it without surrender,Premise
it is not enough to stand on this record,Claim
we are dealing with the most ruthless fanatical leaders that the world has ever seen,Premise
in this period of the sixties america must move forward in every area,Claim
although we are today as senator kennedy has admitted the strongest nation in the world militarily we must increase our strength increase it so that we will always have enough strength that regardless of what our potential opponents have  if the should launch a surprise attack  we will be able to destroy their warmaking capability,Premise
they must know in other words that it is national suicide if they begin anything,Claim
we need this kind of strength,Claim
were the guardians of the peace,Premise
we need to see that the economy of this country continues to grow,Claim
it has grown in the past seven years,Premise
it can and will grow even more in the next four,Claim
we have things to do at home,Premise
were in a race for survival  a race in which it isnt enough to be ahead it isnt enough simply to be complacent,Premise
we have to move ahead in order to stay ahead,Claim
that is why in this field i have made recommendations which i am confident will move the american economy ahead  move it firmly and soundly so that there will never be a time when the soviet union will be able to challenge our superiority in this field,Premise
we need military strength,Claim
we need economic strength,Claim
we also need the right diplomatic policies,Claim
we turn to the past,Premise
firmness but no belligerence and by no belligerence i mean that we do not answer insult by insult,Premise
when you are proud and confident of your strength you do not get down to the level of mr khrushchev and his colleagues,Premise
that example that president eisenhower has set we will continue to follow,Premise
all this by itself is not enough,Claim
it is not enough for us simply to be the strongest nation militarily the strongest economically and also to have firm diplomacy,Claim
we must have a great goal,Claim
that is not just to keep freedom for ourselves but to extend it to all the world to extend it to all the world,Claim
that is americas destiny,Premise
to extend it to all the world,Claim
the communist aim is not to hold their own but to extend communism,Premise
you cannot fight a victory for communism or a strategy of victory for communism with the strategy simply of holding the line,Claim
so i say that we believe that our policies of military strength of economic strength of diplomatic firmness first will keep the peace and keep it without surrender,Premise
we also believe that in the great field of ideals that we can lead america to the victory for freedom  victory in the newly developing countries victory also in the captive countries  provided we have faith in ourselves and faith in our principles,Premise
i voted for the formosa resolution in 1955,Premise
i have sustained it since then,Claim
ive said that i agree with the administration policy,Premise
mr nixon earlier indicated that he would defend quemoy and matsu even if the attack on these islands two miles off the coast of china were not part of a general attack an formosa and the pescadores,Premise
i indicated that i would defend those islands if the attack were directed against pescadores and formosa which is part of the eisenhower policy,Premise
ive supported that policy,Claim
in the last week as a member of the senate foreign relations committee i have reread the testimony of general twining representing the administration in 1959 and the assistant secretary of state before the foreign relations committee in 1958 and i have accurately described the administration policy and i support it wholeheartedly,Premise
that really isnt an issue in this campaign,Claim
it isnt an issue with mr nixon who now says that he also supports the eisenhower policy,Premise
i dont believe it is,Claim
i dont believe that our relative strength is increasing,Claim
i say that not as the democratic standardbearer but as a citizen of the united states who is concerned about the united states,Premise
i look at cuba ninety miles off the coast of the united states,Premise
in 1957 i was in havana,Premise
i talked to the american ambassador there,Premise
he said that he was the second most powerful man in cuba,Premise
even though ambassador smith and ambassador gardner both republican ambassadors both warned of castro the marxist influences around castro the communist influences around castro both of them have testified in the last six weeks that in spite of their warnings to the american government nothing was done,Premise
our d security depends upon latin america,Claim
at the american conference  interamerican conference this summer when we wanted them to join together in the denunciation of castro and the cuban communists we couldnt even get the interamerican group to join together in denouncing castro,Premise
it was rather a vague statement that they finally made,Premise
do you know today that the com the russians broadcast ten times as many programs in spanish to latin america as we do,Premise
do you know we dont have a single program sponsored by our government to cuba  to tell them our story to tell them that we are their friends that we want them to be free again,Premise
africa is now the emerging area of the world,Claim
it contains twentyfive percent of all the members of the general assembly,Premise
we didnt even have a bureau of african affairs until 1957,Premise
in the africa south of the sahara which is the major new section we have less students from all of africa in that area studying under government auspices today than from the country of thailand,Premise
if theres one thing africa needs its technical assistance,Claim
yet last year we gave them less than five percent of all the technical assistance funds that we distributed around the world,Premise
i dont think they do enough,Claim
we relied in the middle east on the baghdad pact and yet when the iraqi government was changed the baghdad pact broke down,Premise
we relied on the eisenhower doctrine for the middle east which passed the senate,Premise
there isnt one country in the middle east that now endorses the eisenhower doctrine,Premise
thats what should concern us,Claim
on the question of admission of red china only two countries in all of africa voted with us  liberia and the union of south africa,Premise
the rest either abstained or voted against us,Premise
more countries in asia voted against us on that question than voted with us,Premise
i believe that this struggle is going to go on and it may be well decided in the next decade,Premise
i have seen cuba go to the communists,Premise
i have seen communist influence and castro influence rise in latin america,Premise
i have seen us ignore africa,Premise
there are six countries in africa that are members of the united nations,Premise
there isnt a single american diplomatic representative in any of those six,Premise
when guinea became independent the soviet ambassador showed up that very day,Premise
we didnt recognize them for two months,Premise
the american ambassador didnt show up for nearly eight months,Premise
i believe that the world is changing fast,Premise
i dont think this administration has shown the foresight has shown the knowledge has been identified with the great fight which these people are waging to be free to get a better standard of living to live better,Claim
the average income in some of those countries is twentyfive dollars a year,Premise
the communists say come with us look what weve done and weve been in  on the whole uninterested,Premise
i think were going to have to do better,Claim
mr nixon talks about our being the strongest country in the world,Premise
i think we are today,Claim
we were far stronger relative to the communists five years ago and what is of great concern is that the balance of power is in danger of moving with them,Premise
they made a breakthrough in missiles,Premise
by nineteen sixtyone two and three they will be outnumbering us in missiles,Claim
im not as confident as he is that we will be the strongest military power by 1963,Claim
he talks about economic growth as a great indicator of freedom,Premise
i agree with him,Premise
what we do in this country the kind of society that we build that will tell whether freedom will be sustained around the world,Claim
in the last nine months of this year weve had a drop in our economic growth rather than a gain,Premise
weve had the lowest rate of increase of economic growth in the last nine months of any major industrialized society in the world,Premise
i look up and see the soviet flag on the moon,Premise
the fact is that the state department polls on our prestige and influence around the world have shown such a sharp drop that up till now the state department has been unwilling to release them,Premise
they were polled by the usia,Premise
this is a struggle in which were engaged,Claim
we want peace,Premise
we want freedom,Premise
we want security,Premise
we want to be stronger,Premise
we want freedom to gain,Premise
i dont believe in these changing and revolutionary times this administration has known that the world is changing  has identified itself with that change,Claim
i think the communists have been moving with vigor  laos africa cuba  all around the world today theyre on the move,Claim
i think we have to revita1ize our society,Claim
i think we have to demonstrate to the people of the world that were determined in this free country of ours to be first  not first if and not first but and not first when  but first,Claim
when we are strong and when we are first then freedom gains,Premise
then the prospects for peace increase,Premise
then the prospects for our society gain,Premise
i think that senator kennedys policies and recommendations for the handling of the castro regime are probably the most dangers dangerously irresponsible recommendations that hes made during the course of this campaign,Claim
in effect what senator kennedy recommends is that the united states government should give help to the exiles and to those within cuba who oppose the castro regime  provided they are antibatista,Premise
now lets just see what this means,Premise
we have five treaties with latin america including the one setting up the organization of american states in bogota in 1948 in which we have agreed not to intervene in the internal affairs of any other american country  and they as well have agreed to do likewise,Premise
the charter of the united nations  its preamble article i and article ii  also provide that there shall be no intervention by one nation in the internal affairs of another,Premise
if we were to follow that recommendation that we would lose all of our friends in latin america we would probably be condemned in the united nations and we would not accomplish our objective,Claim
it would be an open invitation for mr khrushchev to come in to come into latin america and to engage us in what would be a civil war and possibly even worse than that,Claim
this is the major recommendation that hes made,Premise
we can do what we did with guatemala,Claim
there was a communist dictator that we inherited from the previous administration,Premise
we quarantined mr arbenz,Premise
the result was that the guatemalan people themselves eventually rose up and they threw him out,Premise
we are quarantining mr castro today,Premise
were quarantining him diplomatically by bringing back our ambassador economically by cutting off trade,Premise
senator kennedys suggestion that the trade that we cut off is not significant is just one hundred percent wrong,Claim
we are cutting off the significant items that the cuban regime needs in order to survive,Premise
by cutting off trade by cutting off our diplomatic relations as we have we will quarantine this regime so that the people of cuba themselves will take care of mr castro,Claim
for us to do what senator kennedy has suggested would bring results which i know he would not want and certainly which the american people would not want,Claim
mr nixon uh  shows himself i misinformed,Claim
he surely must be aware that most of the equipment and arms and resources for castro came from the united states flowed out of florida and other parts of the united states to castro in the mountains,Premise
there isnt any doubt about that,Premise
i believe that if any economic sanctions against latin america are going to be successful they have to be multilateral,Claim
they have to include the other countries of latin america,Claim
the very minute effect of the action which has been taken this week on cubas economy  i believe castro can replace those markets very easily through latin america through europe and through eastern europe,Premise
if the united states had stronger prestige and influence in latin america it could persuade  as franklin roosevelt did in 1940  the countries of latin america to join in an economic quarantine of castro,Premise
thats the only way you can bring real economic pressure on the castro regime,Claim
castro is only the beginning of our difficulties throughout latin america,Claim
the big struggle will be to prevent the influence of castro spreading to other countries  mexico panama bolivia colombia,Premise
were going to have to try to provide closer ties to associate ourselves with the great desire of these people for a better life if were going to prevent castros influence from spreading throughout all of latin america,Premise
his influence is strong enough today to prevent us from joi getting the other countries of latin america to join with us in economic quarantine,Premise
his influence is growing,Claim
this administration has ignored latin america,Premise
you yourself said mr vice president a month ago that if we had provided the kind of economic aid five years ago that we are now providing we might never have had castro,Premise
i dont think its a wise idea for presidential candidates to appoint the members of his cabinet prospectively or to suggest four people  indicate that one of them surely will be appointed,Claim
this is a decision that the president of the united states must make,Claim
the last candidate who indicated that he knew who his cabinet was going to be was mr dewey in 1948,Premise
this is a race between the vice president and myself for the presidency of the united states,Premise
there are a good many able men who could be secretary of state,Premise
ive made no judgment about who should be secretary of state,Premise
i think that judgment could be made after election if im successful,Claim
the people have to make a choice between mr nixon and myself between the republican party and the democratic party between our approach to the problems which now disturb us as a nation and disturb us as a world power,Premise
the president bears the constitutional responsibility not the secretary of state for the conduct of foreign affairs,Premise
some presidents have been strong in foreign policy others have relied heavily on the secretary of state,Premise
ive been a member of the senate foreign relations committee,Premise
i run for the presidency with full knowledge that his great responsibility really given to him by the constitution and by the force of events is in the field of foreign affairs,Premise
im asking the peoples support as president,Premise
we will select the best man we can get,Claim
ive not made a judgment,Premise
i have not narrowed down a list of three or four people among whom would be the candidate,Premise
i have consistently answered all questions with regard to who will be in the next cabinet by saying that that is the responsibility of the next president and it would be inappropriate to make any decisions on that or to announce any prior to the time that i had the right to do so,Claim
i would like to point out that when we look at our programs in latin america we find that we have appropriated five times as much for latin america as was appropriated by the previous administration,Premise
we have two billion dollars more for the exportimport bank,Premise
we have a new bank for latin america alone of a billion dollars,Premise
we have the new program which was submitted at the bogota conference  this new program that president eisenhower submitted approved by the last congress  for five hundred million dollars,Premise
we have moved in latin america very effectively,Premise
senator kennedy complains very appropriately about our inadequate ra radio broadcasts for latin america,Premise
let me point out again that his congress  the democratic congress  has cut eighty million dollars off of the voice of america appropriations,Premise
he has to get a better job out of his congress if hes going to get us the money that we need to conduct the foreign affairs of this country in latin america or any place else,Premise
i naturally am aware of it,Claim
i of course pay attention to everything senator kennedy says as well as senator fulbright,Premise
the facts simply arent as stated,Claim
the report to which senator kennedy refers is one that was made many many months ago and related particularly to the uh  period immediately after sputnik,Premise
as far as this report is concerned i would have no objection to having it made public,Premise
i would say this with regard to this report with regard to gallup polls of prestige abroad and everything else that weve been hearing about what about american prestige abroad americas prestige abroad will be just as high as the spokesmen for america allow it to be,Premise
were not,Claim
the united states is second in space,Claim
the fact of the matter is that the space score today is twentyeight to eight,Premise
weve had twentyeight successful shots theyve had eight,Premise
were second in education,Claim
i have seen soviet education and ive seen ours,Premise
were second in science,Claim
they may be ahead in one area or another,Premise
overall were way ahead of the soviet union and all other countries in science,Claim
we have the worst slums,Claim
we have the most crowded schools,Claim
seventeen million people go to bed hungry every night,Claim
it can only have the effect certainly of reducing it,Claim
senator kennedy has a responsibility to criticize those things that are wrong but he has also a responsibility to be right in his criticism,Premise
every one of these items that i have mentioned hes been wrong  dead wrong,Claim
he has contributed to any lack of prestige,Claim
as far as prestige is concerned the first place it would show up would be in the united nations,Premise
senator kennedy has referred to the vote on communist china,Premise
lets look at the vote on hungary,Premise
we got more votes for condemning hungary and looking into that situation than we got the last year,Premise
lets look at the reaction eh  reaction to khrushchev and eisenhower at the last un session,Premise
did khrushchev gain because he took his shoe off and pounded the table and shouted and insulted not at all,Premise
the president gained,Premise
america gained by continuing the dignity the decency that has characterized us and its that that keeps the prestige of america up not running down america the way senator kennedy has been running her down,Claim
i really dont need uh  mr nixon to tell me about what my responsibilities are as a citizen,Claim
ive served this country for fourteen years in the congress and before that in the service,Premise
ive just as high a devotion just as high an opinion,Premise
what i downgrade mr nixon is the leadership the country is getting not the country,Premise
i didnt make most of the statements that you said i made,Claim
i believe the soviet union is first in outer space,Claim
we have  may have made more shots but the size of their rocket thrust and all the rest,Premise
you yourself said to khrushchev you may be ahead of us in rocket thrust but were ahead of you in color television in your famous discussion in the kitchen,Premise
i think that color television is not as important as rocket thrust,Claim
i didnt say we had the worst slums in the world,Claim
i said we had too many slums,Premise
i didnt say we had the worst education in the world,Claim
what i said was that ten years ago we were producing twice as many scientists and engineers as the soviet union and today theyre producing twice as many as we are and that this affects our security around the world,Premise
that they are bad and we ought to do something about them,Premise
we ought to support housing legislation which this administration has opposed,Premise
i believe that the polls and other studies and votes in the united nations and anyone reading the paper and any citizen of the united states must come to the conclusion that the united states no longer carries the same image of a vital society on the move with its brightest days ahead as it carried a decade or two decades ago,Claim
weve stood still here at home,Premise
we havent met our problems in the united states,Premise
we havent had a moving economy,Premise
the soviet union made a breakthrough in outer space,Premise
that made the people of the world begin to wonder whether we were first in science,Claim
were first in other areas of science but in space which is the new science were not first,Claim
the russians may have resumed the testing of nuclear devices,Claim
i think the next president of the united states should make one last effort to secure an agreement on the cessation of tests,Claim
i think we should go back to geneva whos ever elected president mr nixon or myself and try once again,Claim
i hope we can come to an agreement because it does not merely involve now the united states britain france and the soviet union as atomic powers,Premise
new breakthroughs in atomic energy technology theres some indications that by the time the next presidents term of office has come to an end there may be ten fifteen or twenty countries with an atomic capacity perhaps that many testing bombs with all the effect that it could have on the atmosphere and with all the chances that more and more countries will have an atomic capacity with more and more chance of war,Premise
one more effort should be made,Claim
i dont think that even if that effort fails that it will be necessary to carry on tests in the atmosphere which pollute the atmosphere,Claim
they can be carried out underground,Premise
they c could be carried on in outer space,Premise
i believe the effort should be made once more by whos ever elected president of the united states,Claim
if we fail its been a great serious failure for everyone  for the human race,Claim
if we fail responsibility will be clearly on the russians and then well have to meet our responsibilities to the security of the united states and there may have to be testing underground,Claim
i think the atomic energy committee is prepared for it,Claim
there may be testing in outer space,Claim
i hope it will not be necessary for any power to resume uh  testing in the atmosphere,Premise
its possible to detect those kind of tests,Premise
the kind of tests which you cant detect are underground or in  in uh  perhaps in outer space,Premise
that im hopeful we can try once more,Premise
if we fail then we must meet our responsibilities to ourselves,Claim
im most concerned about the whole problem of the spread of atomic weapons,Premise
china may have it by 1963 egypt,Premise
war has been the constant companion of mankind so to have these weapons disseminated around the world i believe means that were going to move through a period of hazard in the next few years,Premise
we ought to make one last effort,Claim
the soviet union is actually filibustering,Claim
we must have in mind the fact that we have been negotiating to get tests inspected and uh  to get an agreement for many many months,Premise
theres been a moratorium on testing as a result of the fact that we have been negotiating,Premise
they may be cheating,Claim
i dont think we can wait until the next president is inaugurated and then uh  select a new team and then all the months of negotiating that will take place before we reach a decision,Claim
i think that immediately after this election we should set a timetable  the next president working with the present president president eisenhower  a timetable to break the soviet filibuster,Claim
there should be no tests in the atmosphere,Claim
we should not allow this soviet filibuster to continue,Claim
i think its time for them to fish or cut bait,Claim
i think that the next president immediately after his election should sit down with the president work out a timetable and  get a decision on this before january of next year,Claim
the conditions i laid out in one of our previous television debates,Premise
its rather difficult to be much more specific than that,Premise
we have to have adequate preparation for a summit conference,Claim
this means at the secretary of state level and at the ambassadorial level,Premise
by adequate preparation i mean that at that level we must prepare an agenda an agenda agreed upon with the approval of the heads of state involved,Premise
this agenda should delineate those issues on which there is a possibility of some agreement or negotiation,Claim
i dont believe we should go to a summit conference unless we have such an agenda unless we have some reasonable insur assurance from mr khrushchev that he intends seriously to negotiate on those points,Claim
his may seem like a rigid inflexible position,Premise
lets look at the other side of the coin,Premise
if we build up the hopes of the world by having a summit conference that is not adequately prepared and then if mr khrushchev finds some excuse for breaking it up  as he did this one  because he isnt going to get his way  wed set back the cause of peace,Claim
we do not help it,Claim
we can in other words negotiate many of these items of difference between us without going to the summit,Premise
i think we have to make a greater effort than we have been making at the secretary of state level at the ambassadorial level to work out the differences that we have,Claim
so far as the summit conference is concerned it should only be entered in upon it should only be agreed upon if the negotiations have reached the point that we have some reasonable assurance that something is going to come out of it other than some phony spirit  a spirit of geneva or camp david or whatever it is,Premise
the soviet union simply doesnt intend to carry out what they say,Premise
i cannot be more precise than that,Claim
until we see what mr khrushchev does and what he says uh  we cannot indicate what our plans will be,Premise
i think the president of the united states last winter indicated that before hed go to the summit in may he did last fall he indicated that there should be some agenda that there should be some prior agreement,Premise
he hoped that there would be uh  b be an agreement in part in disarmament,Premise
he also expressed the hope that there should be some understanding of the general situation in berlin,Premise
the soviet union refused to agree to that and we went to the summit and it was disastrous,Premise
i believe we should not go to the summit until there is some reason to believe that a meeting of minds can be obtained on either berlin outer space or general disarmament  including nuclear testing,Claim
i believe the next president in january and february should go to work in building the strength of the united states,Claim
the soviet union does understand strength,Premise
we arm to parley winston churchill said ten years ago,Premise
if we are strong particularly as we face a crisis over berlin  which we may in the spring or in the winter  its important that we maintain our determination here that we indicate that were building our strength that we are determined to protect our position that were determined to protect our commitment,Claim
i believe we should indicate our desire to live at peace with the world,Claim
until were strong here until were moving here i believe a summit could not be successful,Claim
i hope that before we do meet there will be preliminary agreements on those four questions or at least two of them or even one of them which would warrant such a meeting,Premise
i think if we had stuck by that position last winter we would have been in a better position in may,Claim
one of the areas and of course the most vulnerable area is  i have felt has been eastern europe,Claim
ive been critical of the administrations failure to suggest policies which would make it possible for us to establish for example closer relations with poland particularly after the fiftyfivefiftysix period and the hungarian revolution,Premise
we indicated at that time that we were not going to intervene militarily,Premise
there was a period there when poland demonstrated a national independence and even the polish government moved some differn di distance away from the soviet union,Premise
eastern europe is the area of vulnerability of the uh  s of the soviet union,Claim
i suggested that we amend our legislation so that we could enjoy closer economic ties,Premise
we received the support first of the administration and then not and we were defeated by one vote in the senate,Premise
we passed the bill in the senate this year but it didnt pass the house,Premise
the relations between russia and china,Claim
they are now engaged in a debate over whether war is the means of communizing the world or whether they should use subversion infiltration economic struggles and all the rest,Premise
i think the next president of the united states should watch it carefully,Claim
if those two powers should split it could have great effects throughout the entire world,Premise
i believe that india represents a great area for affirmative action by the free world,Claim
india started from about the same place that china did,Premise
chinese communists have been moving ahead the last ten years,Premise
india under a free society has been making some progress,Premise
if india does not succeed  with her four hundred and fifty million people if she cant make freedom work  then people around the world are going to determine  particularly in the underdeveloped world  that the only way that they can develop their resources is through the communist system,Claim
in africa asia latin america eastern europe the great force on our side is the desire of people to be free,Claim
this has expressed itself in the revolts in eastern europe,Premise
its expressed itself in the desire of the people of africa to be independent of western europe,Premise
they want to be free,Claim
my judgment is that they dont want to give their freedom up to become communists,Claim
they want to stay free independent perhaps of us but certainly independent of the communists,Claim
i believe if we identify ourselves with that force if we identify ourselves with it as lincoln as wilson did as franklin roosevelt did if we become known as the friend of freedom sustaining freedom helping freedom helping these people in the fight against poverty and ignorance and disease helping them build their lives i believe in latin america africa and asia eventually in the eastern europe and the middle east certainly in western europe we can strengthen freedom,Claim
we can make it move,Claim
we can put the communists on the defensive,Claim
this should continue,Claim
it can be stepped up to give them hope and to keep alive the hope for freedom that i can testify they have so deeply within them,Claim
with regard to poland when i talked to mr gomulka the present leader of poland for six hours in warsaw last year i learned something about their problems and particularly his,Premise
right under the soviet gun with soviet troops there he is in a very difficult position in taking anything independent a position which would be independent of the soviet union,Premise
lets just see what weve done for poland a half a billion dollars worth of aid has gone to poland primarily economic primarily to go to the people of poland,Premise
we can have more exchange with poland or with any other of the iron curtain countries which show some desire to take a different path than the path that has been taken by the ones that are complete satellites of the soviet union,Premise
if we can get that across to the people of these countries in this decade of the sixties the struggle for freedom will be won,Claim
we want to help them,Claim
not because were simply trying to save our own skins,Premise
not because were simply trying to fight communism,Premise
we care for them,Premise
we stand for freedom,Premise
if there were no communism in the world we would still fight poverty and misery and disease and tyranny,Premise
if we are going to have the initiative in the world we must remember that the people of africa and asia and latin america dont want to be pawns simply in a struggle between two great powers  the soviet union and the united states,Premise
the issue will stay with us as a campaign issue just as long as senator kennedy persists in what i think is a fundamental error,Claim
he says he supports the presidents position,Premise
he says that he voted for the resolution,Premise
he voted for the resolution in 1955 which gave the president the power to use the forces of the united states to defend formosa and the offshore islands,Premise
he also voted then for an amendment  which was lost fortunately  an amendment which would have drawn a line and left out those islands and denied the p right to the president to defend those islands if he thought that it was an attack on formosa,Premise
he repeated that error in 1959 in the speech that he made,Premise
he repeated it again in a television debate that we had,Premise
senator kennedy has got to be consistent here,Claim
either hes for the president and hes against the position that those who opposed the president in fiftyfive and fiftynine  and the senators position itself stated the other day in our debate  either he is for the president and against that position or we simply have a disagreement here that must continue to be debated,Premise
if the senator in his answer to this question will say i now will depart or retract my previous views i think i was wrong in i 955 i think i was wrong in 1959 and i think i was wrong in our television debate to say that we should draw a line leaving out quemoy and matsu  draw a line in effect abandoning these islands to the communists then this will be right out of the campaign,Claim
there will be no issue between us,Premise
i support the presidents position,Premise
i have always opposed drawing a line,Claim
i have opposed drawing a line,Claim
i know that the moment you draw a line that is an encouragement for the communists to attack  to step up their blackmail and to force you into the war that none of us want,Premise
i would hope that senator kennedy in his answer today would clear it up,Premise
it isnt enough for him to say i support the presidents position that i voted for the resolution,Claim
of course he voted for the resolution  it was virtually unanimous,Premise
what about his error in voting for the amendment which was not adopted and then persisting in it in fiftynine persisting in it in the debate,Premise
its very simple for him to clear it up,Claim
he can say now that he no longer believes that a line should be drawn leaving these islands out of the perimeter of defense,Premise
if he says that this issue will not be discussed in the campaign,Claim
i support that,Claim
the resolution commits the president in the united states which i supported to defend uh  formosa the pescadores and if it was his military judgment these islands,Premise

in view of the difficulties weve had with the islands in view of the difficulties and disputes weve had with chiang kaishek thats the only position we can take,Claim
thats not the position you took,Claim
the first position you took when this matter first came up was that we should draw the line and commit ourselves as a matter of principle to defend these islands,Premise
not as part of the defense of formosa and the pescadores,Premise
you showed no recognition of the administration program to try to persuade chiang kaishek for the last five years to withdraw from the islands,Premise

that specific charge was made in a press statement by gore campaign spokesman mark fabiani not in a tv guide,Premise
mr hankins i dont feel good about it,Claim
i think we ought to have a patients bill of rights to take the medical decisions away from the hmos and give them back to the doctors and nurses,Claim
i would just like to say that this debate in a way is a living tribute to mel carnahan,Claim
he loved the vigorous discussion of ideas in our democracy,Premise
he was a fantastic governor of missouri,Claim
this state became one of the top five in the nation for health care coverage for children under his leadership,Claim
i support a strong national patients bill of rights,Claim
one of the best in advancing all kinds of benefits for children to grow up healthy and strong,Claim
i would like to also extend sympathy to the families of those who have died and those who are still missing and the injured,Claim
of course this debate also takes place at a time when the tragedy of the uss cole is on our minds and hearts and insofar as the memorial service is tomorrow,Premise
mr hankins i think that the situation that you describe has gotten completely out of hand,Claim
doctors are giving prescriptions theyre recommending treatments and then their recommendations are being overruled by hmos and insurance companies,Premise
that is unacceptable,Claim
it is actually a disagreement between us,Claim
a national law that is pending on this the dinglenorwood bill a bipartisan bill is one that i support and that the governor does not,Claim
its a tragic moment,Claim
i too want to extend my prayers and blessings gods blessings on the families whose lives were overturned yes  tod  last night,Premise

mr vice president and i want all people covered,Claim
its time for our nation to come together and do whats right for the people,Claim
i think this is right for the people,Claim
if the insurance company doesnt follow the findings of the iro then that becomes a cause of action in a court of law,Claim
if the objective body rules on your behalf the insurance company must follow those rules,Claim
it says if youâ€™ve got a complaint with your insurance company you can take your complaint to an objective body,Claim
as a matter of fact i brought republicans and democrats together to do just that in the state of texas to get a patients bill of rights through,Claim
thats what we did in my state,Claim
in order to get something done on behalf of the people you have to put partisanship aside,Claim
we have one of the most advanced patients bill of rights,Claim
it says for example that a woman doesnt have to go through a gate keeper to go to her gynecologist,Premise
it says that you cant gag a doctor doctor can advise you,Premise
the hmo the insurance company cant gag that doctor from giving you full advice,Premise
this particular bill it allows patients to choose a doctor their own doctor if they want to,Premise
we did something else that was interesting,Claim
were one of the first states that said you can sue an hmo for denying you proper coverage,Claim
now theres whats called an independent review organization that you have to go through first,Claim
absolutely not,Claim
it is the bipartisan bill that is now pending in the congress,Claim
i referred to the dinglenorwood bill,Premise
they like it,Claim
it doesnt accomplish what i think really needs to be accomplished to give the decisions back to the doctors and nurses and give you a right of appeal to somebody other than the hmo or insurance company let you go to the nearest emergency room without having to call an hmo before you call 911 to let you see a specialist if you need to,Premise
it has strong bipartisan support,Premise
it is being blocked by the republican leadership in the congress,Premise
the difference is is that i can get it done,Claim
i believe i can,Claim
its not only whats your philosophy and whats your position on issues,Claim
can you get things done,Claim
thats what the question in this campaign is about,Claim

people will be able to take their hmo insurance company to court,Claim
thats what ive done in texas,Claim
thats the kind of leadership style ill bring to washington,Claim
i think one of the problems we have particularly for seniors is there is no prescription drug coverage in medicare,Claim
i think step one to make sure prescription drugs is more affordable for seniors,Claim
those are the folks who really rely upon prescription drugs a lot these days is to reform the medicare system is to have prescription drugs as an integral part of medicare once and for all,Claim
when they have to try to purchase drugs they do so on their own theres no kind of collective bargaining no power of purchasing among seniors,Claim
i think price controls would hurt our ability to continue important research and development,Claim
im against price controls,Claim
im against price controls,Claim
the best thing to do is to reform medicare,Claim
i think its important to have whats called immediate helping hand which is direct money to states,Claim
seniors poor seniors dont have to choose between food and medicine,Claim
i want to call upon republicans and democrats to forget all the arguing and finger pointing and come together and take care of our seniors prescription drug program that says well pay for the poor seniors well help all seniors with prescription drugs,Claim
the problem we have today is like the patients bill of rights particularly with health care theres a lot of bickering in washington dc,Claim
its kind of like a political issue as opposed to a people issue,Premise
thats part of an overall overhaul,Premise
one of the most important things is to continue the research and development component,Claim
that makes sense,Claim
allowing the new bill that was passed in the congress made sense to allow for you know drugs that were sold overseas to come back and other countries to come back into the united states,Claim
expediting drugs through the fda makes sense of course,Claim
i want to streamline the approval of the competing generic drugs and the new kinds of treatments that can compete with them,Claim
we bring the price down for everybody,Claim
if you pass the big drug companies bill nothing will happen,Claim
ill bring new competition to bring the price down,Claim
if you have extraordinarily high cost then they pay all over 4000 outofpocket,Claim
if youre poor they pay all of it,Claim
nobody can overrule your doctor,Claim
the doctor chooses the prescription that you need,Premise
this is your man,Claim
if you want someone who will spend a lot of words describing a whole convoluted process and then end up supporting legislation that is supported by the big drug companies,Premise
i want to fight for you,Claim
if you want someone who will fight for you and who will fight for the middleclass families and working men and women who are sick and tired of having their parents and grandparents pay higher prices for prescription drugs than anybody else,Premise
its not only seniors,Premise
you asked a great question,Claim
for 24 years i have never been afraid to take on the big drug companies,Claim
thats great,Claim
they do some great things,Premise
they discover great new cures,Premise
we want them to continue that,Claim
they can keep charging these very high prices,Claim
they are trying artificially extend the monopoly patent protection,Premise
you see all these ads,Claim
they are now spending more money on advertising and promotion,Premise
than they are on research and development,Premise
i propose a real prescription drug benefit under medicare for all seniors,Claim
you pick your own doctor and nobody can take that away from you,Claim
you go to your own pharmacy and then medicare pays half the price,Claim
i think that we should move stepbystep toward universal health coverage,Claim
i am not in favor of government doing it all,Claim
that is a national outrage,Claim
weve spent 65 years now on the development of a hybrid system partly private partly public,Premise
85 of our people have health insurance 15 dont,Premise
that adds up to 44 million people,Premise
now we have a big difference on this,Claim
i want to give seniors who are well the near elderly,Claim
i dont like that term,Claim
i am just about in that category,Premise
those 55 to 65 ought to be able to buy into medicare for premiums that are reasonable and fair and significantly below what they have to get now,Claim
i want to give small business employers a tax credit 25 to encourage the providing of health insurance for the employees in small businesses,Claim
i want to give a tax credit for the purchase of individual health insurance plans,Claim
then well fill other gaps by covering the parents of those children when the family is poor or up to two and a half times the poverty rate,Claim
i will make a commitment to bring health care coverage of high quality that is affordable to every single child in america within four years,Claim
we have got to deal with longterm care,Claim
we have got to get health coverage for those who do not have it,Claim
weve got to improve the quality for those who do with a patients bill of rights thats real and that works the dinglenorwood bill,Claim
we have got to fill in the gaps in coverage by finally bringing parity for the treatment of mental illness,Claim
thats been left out,Premise
you need to know the record here,Claim
under governor bush texas has sunk to be 50th out of 50 in health care  in health insurance for their citizens,Premise
im absolutely opposed to a national health care plan,Claim
thats what we ought to do for all people in america,Claim
we have to trust people to make decisions with their lives,Claim
health care needs to be affordable and available,Claim
we need a 2000 credit rebate for people working people that dont have insurance,Claim
they can get in the marketplace and start purchasing insurance,Premise
we need to allow small businesses to write insurance across jurisdictional lines,Claim
small business can afford health care small restaurants can afford health care,Claim
i dont want the federal government making decisions for consumers or for providers,Claim
fortunately it failed,Claim
i remember what the administration tried to do in 1993,Premise
they tried to have a national health care plan,Premise
i trust people,Claim
i dont trust the federal government,Claim
its going to be one of the themes you hear tonight,Claim
i dont want the federal government making decisions on behalf of everybody,Claim
there is an issue with the uninsured there sure is,Claim
the question is are people getting health care,Claim
we have a strong safety net and there needs to be a safety net in america,Claim
there needs to be more community health clinics where the poor can go get health care,Claim
we need a program for the uninsured,Claim
were providing health care for our people,Claim
we have uninsured people in my state,Premise
ours is a big state a fastgrowing state,Premise
in the medicare reform i talk about it says if you are a senior you can stay in medicare if you like it,Premise
thats fine,Claim
were going to give you other choices to choose if you want to do so just like they do the federal employees,Claim
the people that work in washington dc for the us,Premise
get a variety of choices to make in their lives,Premise
ive heard a lot about education and the need to hold teachers and schools accountable,Premise
i certainly agree with that,Claim
its hard to make people love one another,Claim
i wish i knew the law,Claim
i would darn sure sign it,Claim
i wish i knew the law that said all of us would be good parents,Claim
one of the things the next president must do is to remind people that if we are going to have a responsible period in america that each of us must love our children with all our heart and all our soul,Claim
i think when you measure and post results on the internet or in the town newspapers most parents say wait a minute my childs school isnt doing what i want it to do and therefore become involved in education,Claim
i recognize there are some who just dont seem to care,Claim
thats why im so strong for accountability,Claim
i happened to believe strong accountability encourages parental involvement though,Premise
i believe we ought to measure a lot three four five six seven eighth grade,Claim
there are a lot of parents who feel like everything is going well in their childs school,Premise
all of a sudden they wake up and realize that wait a minute standards arent being met,Premise
they cant be sued,Claim
we cant continue to shuffle children through school,Claim
instead of just comes the soft bigotry of low expectations that there has to be a consequence,Claim
i also believe that we need to say to people that if you cannot meet standards there has to be a consequence,Claim
i think parents will be more involved with education when they know their childrens classrooms are safe and secure as well,Claim
thats why i support a teacher liability act at the federal level,Claim
that says if a teacher or principal upholds reasonable standards of classroom discipline they cant be sued,Premise
we do so in my state of texas,Premise
one of the good things weve gone in texas is we have strong accountability,Claim
you cant cure unless you know,Claim
you cant solve a problem unless you diagnose it,Claim
i strongly believe that one of the best things to encourage parental involvement also is to know that the classrooms will be safe and secure,Claim
one of the consequences to allow parents to have different choices,Claim
i think thats a mistake,Claim
i think we should make it the number one priority to make our schools the best in the world all of them,Claim
i dont think we should give up on the private schools and leave kids trapped in failing schools,Claim
only one in 20 students would be eligible for these vouchers,Premise
they wouldnt even pay the full tuition to private school,Premise
governor bush is for vouchers,Premise
in his plan he proposes to drain more money more taxpayer money out of the public schools for private school vouchers than all of the money that he proposes in his entire budget for public schools themselves,Premise
i want to work for universal free school,Claim
we know from all the studies that the youngsters learn kids learn more in the first few years of life than any where else,Premise
i want to give every middleclass family a 10000 a year tax deduction for college tuition,Claim
middleclass families will always be able to send their kids on to college,Claim
we need to give teachers the training and professional development that they need including a paid time off to go visit the classroom of a master teacher to pick up some new skills,Claim
it means also helping local school districts that sometimes find the parents of school age children outvoted on bond issues to give them some help with interestfree bonding authority,Premise
we can build new schools and modernize the classrooms,Claim
it means in my plan hiring bonuses to get 100000 new teachers in the public schools within the next four years,Premise
the teacher can spend enough oneonone time with each student,Claim
where there are no failing schools,Premise
where the classrooms are small enough in size number of students,Premise
now that means recruiting new teachers for the public schools,Premise
i see a day in the united states of america where all of our public schools are considered excellent world class,Premise
i strongly believe in local control of schools,Claim
i dont like it when the federal government tells us what to do,Claim
i believe in local control of schools,Claim
whats unreasonable about that,Claim
there has to be a consequence,Claim
we want the schools to show us whether or not the children are learning,Claim
we spend federal money on disadvantaged children,Premise
we expect there to be measurement,Claim
we expect there to be standards met,Claim
if we find success well praise it,Claim
there has to be a consequence,Claim
when we find children trapped in schools that will not change and will not teach instead of saying oh this is okay in america just to shuffle poor kids through schools,Premise
the parent can go to a tutoring program or another public school or another private school,Claim
the consequence is that federal portion or federal money will go to the parent,Claim
it works great,Claim
its based on the plan of governor jim hunt in north carolina,Premise
under my plan if a school is failing we work with the states to give them the authority and the resources to close down that school and reopen it right away with a new principal a new faculty a turnaround team of specialists who know what theyre doing,Claim
the program that hes proposing is not the one that he just described,Claim
described under your plan governor bush states would be required to pay vouchers to students to match the vouchers so that the federal government would put up,Premise
if a school was designated as failing the kids would be trapped there for another three years and then some of them would get federal vouchers and the state would be forced to match those that money,Premise
we have to make sure that all of them are,Claim
most schools are excellent,Premise
i have an obligation to fight to make sure there are no failing schools,Claim
if i thought that there was no alternative then i might feel differently,Claim
we have to start treating teachers like the professionals that they are and give them the respect and the kind of quality of life that will draw more people into teaching,Claim
we need a lot more teachers,Claim
it requires testing of all new teachers including in the subjects that they teach,Claim
it also requires something that governor bushs plan doesnt,Claim
my plan requires testing of all students,Premise
weve got to do something about this,Claim
theyre not able to do it,Claim
our future depends upon it,Claim
weve got the largest generation of students in public schools ever,Claim
more than 90 of americas children go to public schools,Premise
its the largest number ever this year and theyll break the record next year and every year for ten years running,Claim
its not enough to leave it up to the local school districts,Claim
its ironic that there is now a smaller percentage of the voters made up of parents with children than ever in american history because of the aging of our population,Claim
traditionally if youve been involved in a campaign like that you know that the parents with kids in school are the ones that turn out and vote,Premise
our economic future depends upon whether or not our children are going to get the kind of education that lets them go on to college,Claim
i want to make it possible for all middleclass families to send their kids to college and more pell grants for those who are in the lower income groups also,Claim
i want to make sure that we have job training on top of that and lifelong learning,Claim
it all starts with the public school teachers,Claim
my proposal gives 10000 hiring bonuses for those teachers who get certified to teach in the areas where theyre most needed,Claim
i believe strongly in a teacher protection act like i mentioned,Claim
i believe strongly that the federal government can help,Claim
we need to fund headstart,Claim
we need to have accountability,Claim
the vice presidents plan does not have annual accountability third grade fourth grade fifth grade,Claim
we need to demand on results,Claim
there needs to be flexibility for teacher training and teacher hiring with federal money,Claim
i believe in flexibility,Claim
i believe in a national reading initiative for local districts to access with k through 2 diagnostic testing curriculum that works phonics works,Claim
it needs to be a part of our curriculum,Claim
im going to ask the congress to pass a teacher protection act,Claim
you cant have a consequence for somebody without fear of getting sued under federal law,Claim
you cant control the classroom,Claim
i worry about federalizing education if i were you,Claim
one size does not fit all,Claim
what i want to do is to send flexibility and authority to the local folks,Claim
you can choose what to do with the money,Claim
they ought to say this is the most important thing we do as a state,Claim
thats what governors ought to do,Claim
i have been a governor of a big state,Premise
i have made education my number one priority,Premise
theres just not going to be enough money,Claim
when you total up all the federal spending he wants to do its the largest increase in federal spending in years,Claim
i hear from teachers all the time about the lawsuits and the threats respect in the classroom,Premise
education is really funded at the local level,Premise
dont fall prey to all this stuff about money here and money there,Claim
94 comes from the local level,Premise
absolutely not,Claim
i will pay down the debt every single year until it is eliminated early in the next decade,Claim
im not just talking,Claim
im not just saying this,Claim
the problem is that under governor bushs plan 16 trillion tax cut mostly to the wealthy under his own budget numbers he proposes spending more money for a tax cut just for the wealthiest 1 than all the new money he budgets for education health care and national defense combined,Premise
now under my plan well balance the budget every year,Claim
i have helped to balance the budget for the first time in 30 years paid down the debt,Premise
under my plan in four years as the percentage of our gross domestic product federal spending will be the smallest that it has been in 50 years,Claim
that gets rid of the third biggest intrusion of the federal government in our economy,Premise
because the governor has all this money for a tax cut mostly to the wealthy there is no money left over,Claim
schools get testing and lawsuit reform and not much else,Claim
hes wrong,Claim
its three times bigger than what president clinton proposed,Claim
just add up all the numbers,Premise
i believe the people who pay the bills ought to get some money back,Claim
i think if youre going to have tax relief everybody ought to get it,Claim
i dont think thats the role of the president to pick youre right and youre not right,Claim
if you pay taxes you ought to get tax relief,Claim
we just have a different philosophy,Claim
he proposed more than walter mondale and michael dukakis combined,Premise
this is a big spender,Claim
the vice president believes only the right people ought to get tax relief,Premise
wealthy people are going to get it,Claim
what ive done is set priorities and funded them,Claim
we structured the plan so that six million additional american families pay no taxes,Claim
the top 1 will end up paying onethird of the taxes in america and they get onefifth of the benefits,Premise
if youre a family of four making 50000 in missouri you get a 50 cut in your federal income taxes,Premise
its just the right position to take,Claim
of course it does,Claim
if you pay taxes you are going to get a benefit,Claim
people who pay taxes will get tax relief,Claim
i want to do something about that,Claim
thats not right,Claim
if youre a single mother making 22000 a year today and youre trying to raise two children for every additional dollar you earn you pay a higher marginal rate on that dollar than someone making 200000,Premise
this is a fair plan,Claim
afterwards they pay 64,Premise
under my plan if you make the wealthy people pay 62 of the taxes today,Premise
the tax code is unfair for people at the bottom end of the economic ladder,Premise
this isnt about governor bush,Claim
 its not about me,Claim
it is about you,Claim

the statement that senator kennedy made was that  to the effect that there were triggerhappy republicans,Premise
that my stand on quemoy and matsu was an indication of triggerhappy republicans,Premise
i resent that comment,Claim
i resent it,Claim
its an implication that republicans have been triggerhappy,Premise
would lead this nation into war,Claim
there isnt any question about the necessity of defending berlin,Claim
the rights of people there to be free,Claim
there isnt any question about what the united american people  republicans and democrats alike  would do in the event there were an attempt by the communists to take over berlin,Claim
weve been strong,Premise
we havent been triggerhappy,Premise
we got rid of that,Premise
weve kept out of other wars,Premise

the chinese communists say over and over again that their objective is not the offshore islands,Premise
they consider them only steppingstones to taking formosa  in the event that their attack then were a prelude to an attack on formosa,Premise

it is something that would lead to war,Claim
this is the history of dealing with dictators,Premise
this is something that senator kennedy and all americans must know,Premise
we tried this with hitler,Premise
it didnt work,Premise

if you surrender or indicate in advance that youre not going to defend any part of the free world,Claim
yes,Claim
i believe we must meet our commitment to uh  formosa,Claim
i support it and the pescadores island,Claim
that is the present american position,Claim
the united states now has a treaty  which i voted for in the united states senate in 1955  to defend formosa and the pescadores island,Premise
the islands are five or four miles respectively off the coast of china,Premise
the treaty does not include these two islands,Premise
mr nixon suggests that the united states should go to war if these two islands are attacked,Premise
if formosa is attacked or the pescadores or if theres any military action in any area which indicates an attack on formosa and the pescadores then of course the united states is at war to defend its treaty,Claim
this is a serious issue,Claim
i think we ought to understand completely if we disagree and if so where,Claim
the president of the united states has indicated they are not within the treaty area,Premise
they were not within the treaty area when the treaty was passed in fiftyfive,Premise
the commander of the asiatic fleet has said that these islands are not worth the bones of a single american,Premise
mr nixon wants to do is commit us  as i understand him so that we can be clear if theres a disagreement  he wants us to be committed to the defense of these islands merely as the defense of these islands as free territory not as part of the defense of formosa,Premise
we have attempted to persuade chiang kaishek as late as january of 1959 to reduce the number of troops he has on them,Premise
i believe that we should move full time on our missile production particularly on minuteman and on polaris,Claim
it may be a long period,Premise
we must get started immediately,Claim
i feel that another effort should be made by a new administration in january of 1961,Claim
to renew negotiations with the soviet union and see whether its possible to come to some conclusion which will lessen the chances of contamination of the atmosphere,Premise
also lessen the chances that other powers will begin to possess a nuclear capacity,Premise
there are indications because of new inventions that ten fifteen or twenty nations will have a nuclear capacity  including red china  by the end of the presidential office in 1964,Claim
this is extremely serious,Premise
there have been many wars in the history of mankind,Premise
i think would be a great mistake,Claim
to take a chance not make every effort that we could make to provide for some control over these weapons,Premise
i dont feel a real effort has been made an this very sensitive subject not only of nuclear controls but also of general disarmament,Claim
less than a hundred people have been working throughout the entire federal government on this subject,Premise
i believe its been reflected in our success and failures at geneva,Claim
we may not succeed,Premise
the soviet union may not agree to an inspection system,Premise
i think the fate not only of our own civilization,Claim
i think the fate of world and the future of the human race is involved in preventing a nuclear war,Claim
if we cannot succeed then we must strengthen ourselves,Claim
these must be done,Premise
i hope the next administration will  make one last great effort to provide for control of nuclear testing control of nuclear weapons if possible control of outer space free from weapons and also to begin again the subject of general disarmament levels,Claim
yes,Claim
under no circumstances must the united states ever make an agreement based on trust,Claim
yes we should make a great effort,Premise
it isnt a question of the number of people who are working in an administration,Claim
its a question of who they are,Claim
this has been one of the highest level operations in the whole state department right under the president himself,Premise
we must move forward in every possible way to reduce the danger of war,Claim
to move toward controlled disarmament,Claim
to control tests,Claim
when senator kennedy suggests that we havent been making an effort,Premise
he simply doesnt know what hes talking about,Claim
there must be an absolute guarantee,Claim
the united states will not defend the offshore islands,Claim
that amendment put the senate of the united states on record with a majority of the senators own party voting for it,Premise
the majority of republicans  put them on record  against the very position that the senator takes now of surrendering,Premise
which passed the senate overwhelmingly seventy to twelve,Premise
there were too many infantrymen there not enough heavy artillery,Premise
the president has always indicated that we must not make the mistake in dealing with the dictator of indicating that we are going to make a concession at the point of a gun,Premise
whenever you do that inevitably the dictator is encouraged to try it again,Premise
once you do this indicating that you are not going to defend a particular area the inevitable result is that it encourages a man who is determined to conquer the world to press you to the point of no return,Claim
that means war,Premise
we went through this tragic experience leading to world war ii,Premise
we learned our lesson again in korea,Premise
we must not learn it again,Premise
i think the senate was right when they rejected senator kennedys position in 1955,Claim
senator johnson was among those who rejected that position  voted with the seventy against the twelve,Premise
the senate was right,Claim
they knew the lesson of history,Premise
were not going to have peace by giving in and indicating in advance that we are not going to defend what has become a symbol of freedom,Claim
this instance the good intentions of course are a desire for peace,Claim
i would trust that senator kennedy would change his position on this  change it,Claim
as long as he as a major presidential candidate continues to suggest that we are going to turn over these islands,Premise
he is only encouraging the aggressors  the chinese communist and the soviet aggressors  to press the united states,Premise
to press us to the point where war would be inevitable,Premise
the road to war is always paved with good intentions,Premise
i dont think its possible for mr nixon to state the record in distortion of the facts with more precision than he just did,Claim
in 1955 mr dulles at a press conference said the treaty that we have with the republic of china excludes quemoy and matsu from the treaty area,Premise
that was done with much thought and deliberation,Premise
that treaty does not commit the united states to defend anything except formosa and the pescadores and to deal with acts against that treaty area,Claim
i completely sustained the treaty,Premise
i voted for it,Premise
i would take any action necessary to defend the treaty formosa and the pescadores island,Premise
i believe that we should meet our commitments,Claim
if the chinese communists attack the pescadores and formosa they know that it will mean a war,Claim
i stand with the secretary of state mr herter who said these islands were indefensible,Premise
that concept is completely repugnant,Premise
i stand with them,Premise
general twining said they were still doing it in 1959,Premise
to go to war for quemoy and matsu to me would seem an unwarranted and tragic course to take,Premise
the treaty is quite precise,Claim
i sustain the treaty,Claim
mr nixon would add a guarantee to islands five miles off the coast of the republic of china when hes never really protested the communists seizing cuba ninety miles off the coast of the united states,Premise
i would not hand over these islands under any point of gun,Premise
mr truman has his methods of expressing things,Premise
hes been in politics for fifty years,Premise
hes been president of the united states,Premise
they may  are not my style,Premise
i really dont think theres anything that i could say to president truman thats going to cause him to change his particular speaking manner,Claim
yes i think so,Claim
senator kennedy and i have felt mr trumans ire,Premise
i think he can speak with some feeling on this subject,Claim
we all have tempers,Premise
i have one,Premise
senator kennedy has one,Premise
when a mans president of the united states or a former president he has an obligation not to lose his temper in public,Claim
ive noted around the country are the tremendous number of children who come out to see the presidential candidates,Premise
i see mothers holding their babies up,Premise
they can see a man who might be president of the united states,Premise
i know senator kennedy sees them too,Premise
whoever is president is going to be a man that all the children of america will either look up to or will look down to,Claim
im very proud that president eisenhower restored dignity and decency and frankly good language to the conduct of the presidency of the united states,Premise
i could approach president eisenhower in maintaining the dignity of the office,Claim
in seeing to it that whenever any mother or father talks to his child,Premise
he can look at the man in the white house,Premise
there is a man who maintains the kind of standards personally that i would want my child to follow,Premise
of course its a criticism that is being made,Claim
i obviously dont think its valid,Claim
i have supported the administrations position,Premise
i think that that position has been correct,Claim
i think my position has been correct,Claim
i stated over and over again that it was essential during that period that the united states make it clear that we would not tolerate indochina falling under communist domination,Premise
as a result of our taking the strong stand that we did the civil war there was ended,Premise
at least in the south of indochina the communists have moved out,Premise
we do have a strong free bastion there,Premise
looking to the u2 flights i have been supporting the presidents position throughout,Premise
i think the president was correct in ordering these flights,Claim
i think the president was correct certainly in his decision to continue the flights while the conference was going on,Claim
they know as senator kennedy will have to know that if you do that you encourage them to more aggression,Claim
you should not indicate to the communists in advance that youre going to surrender an area thats free,Premise
i never criticized the u2 flights in general,Claim
i never suggested espionage should stop,Claim
mr nixon talked before the newspaper editors in the spring of 1954 about putting american boys into indochina,Premise
the reason indochina was preserved was the result of the geneva conference which indochina,Claim
u2 flight in may just before the conference was a mistake in timing,Claim
the hazards involved if the summit conference had any hope for success,Premise
the vice president indicated that the flights were going on even though the administration and the president had canceled the flights on may twelfth,Premise
vice president suggests that we should keep the communists in doubt about whether we would fight on quemoy and matsu,Premise
thats not the position hes taking,Claim
hes indicating that we should fight for these islands,Claim
they are in the area of freedom,Premise
he didnt take that position on tibet,Premise
he didnt take that position on budapest,Premise
he doesnt take that position that ive seen so far in laos,Premise
guinea and ghana have both moved within the soviet sphere of influence in foreign policy so has cuba,Premise
the united states should meet its commitments to que to uh  formosa and the pescadores,Claim
these islands that were now talking about are not worth the bones of a single american soldier,Premise
i know how difficult it is to sustain troops close to the shore under artillery bombardment,Premise
i think we should make it very clear the disagreement between mr nixon and myself,Claim
i disapprove of the issue,Claim
i do not suggest that mr nixon does in any way,Claim
i dont suggest that,Claim
i dont support it,Claim
thats absurd,Claim
i would disagree with it,Claim
i believe who is the head of the klan who lives in tampa florida indicated in a statement i think two or three weeks ago that he was not going to vote for me,Claim
i do not suggest in any way nor have i ever that that indicates that mr nixon has the slightest sympathy involvement or in any way imply any inferences in regard to the ku klux klan,Premise
mr nixon knows very well that in this whole matter thats been involved with the socalled religious discussion in this campaign ive never suggested even by the vaguest implication that he did anything but disapprove it,Premise
i pointed out that it was my position that americans must choose the best man that either party could produce,Premise
we cant settle for anything but the best,Premise
the best man that this nation can produce,Premise
we cant have any test of religion,Premise
we cant have any test of race,Premise
it must be a test of a man,Premise
we certainly cannot have it in a presidential campaign,Claim
we cannot have it in our hearts,Premise
i obviously repudiate the klan,Claim
i repudiate anybody who uses the religious issue,Claim
i will not tolerate it,Claim
i have ordered all of my people to have nothing to do with it,Premise
if you believe in america,Premise
if you want america to set the right example to the world,Premise
we cannot have religious or racial prejudice,Claim
i have seen communism abroad,Premise
i see what it does,Premise
communism is the enemy of all religions,Premise
we who do believe in god must join together,Premise
we must not be divided on this issue,Claim
the worst thing that i can think can happen in this campaign would be for it to be decided on religious issues,Premise
i believe that in this area the laws which should be passed are ones that will give the president more weapons with which to deal with those strikes,Claim
i have a basic disagreement with senator kennedy though on this point,Claim
he has taken the position he would even favor compulsory arbitration as one of the weapons the president might have to stop a national emergency strike,Premise
i understand he changed that position,Premise
i do not believe we should have either compulsory arbitration or seizure,Claim
i think the moment that you give to the union on the one side,Claim
the escape hatch of eventually going to government to get it settled,Claim
that most of these great strikes will end up being settled by government,Claim
it would mean price control  all the things that we do not want,Premise
i do believe that we can give to the president of the united states powers,Claim
the record in handling them has been very good during this administration,Premise
we have had less manhours lost by strikes in these last seven years than we had in the previous seven years by a great deal,Claim
however good the record is its got to be better,Premise
all americans must move forward together,Premise
weve got to move forward,Premise
we have to get the greatest cooperation possible between labor and management,Premise
we cannot afford stoppages of massive effect on the economy when were in the terrible competition were in with the soviets,Claim
i always have difficulty recognizing my positions when theyre stated by the vice president,Claim
i never suggested that compulsory arbitration was the solution for national emergency disputes,Claim
im opposed to that was opposed to it in october 1958,Premise
the president should be given other weapons to protect the national interest in case of national emergency strikes beyond the injunction provision of the tafthartley act,Claim
i dont know what other weapons the vice president is talking about,Premise
im talking about giving him four or five tools  not only the factfinding committee that he now has under the injunction provision,Premise
not only the injunction,Premise
the power of the factfinding commission to make recommendations  recommendations which would not be binding,Premise
would have great force of public opinion behind them,Premise
one of the additional powers that i would suggest would be seizure,Claim
there might be others,Premise
by the president having five powers  four or five powers  and he only has very limited powers today,Premise
neither the company nor the union would be sure which power would be used,Premise
there would be a greater incentive on both sides to reach an agreement themselves without taking it to the government,Claim
the difficulty now is the presidents course is quite limited,Claim
he can set up a factfinding committee,Premise
the factfinding committees powers are limited,Premise
he can provide an injunction if theres a national emergency for eighty days then the strike can go on,Premise
there are no other powers or actions that the president could take unless he went to the congress,Claim
this is a difficult and sensitive matter,Claim
the president should have a variety of things he could do,Premise
he could leave the parties in doubt as to which one he would use,Premise
there would be incentive instead of as now  the steel companies were ready to take the strike,Claim
they felt the injunction of eighty days would break the union which didnt happen,Premise
yes,Claim
i believe in a balanced budget and have supported that concept during my fourteen years in the congress,Claim
the only two times when an unbalanced budget is warranted would be during a serious recession or a national emergency where there should be large expenditures for national defense,Claim
i have stated that its my best judgment that our agricultural program will cost a billion and a half possibly two billion dollars less than the present agricultural program,Premise
weve spent more money on agriculture in the last eight years than the hundred years of the agricultural department before that,Premise
i believe that the high interestrate policy that this administration has followed has added about three billion dollars a year to interest on the debt,Claim
i would hope that it would be possible to reduce that interest at least a billion dollars,Premise
i think its possible to gain a seven hundred million to a billion dollars through tax changes,Claim
i believe would close up loof loopholes on dividend withholding on expense accounts,Claim
in my judgment we would spend more money in this administration on aid to education,Claim
wed spend more money on housing,Claim
wed spend more money and i hope more wisely on defense than this administration has,Claim
i believe that the next administration should work for a balanced budget,Claim
the medical care for the aged  and the bill if fully implemented would cost a billion dollars on the treasury  out of treasury funds and a billion dollars by the states,Premise
the proposal that i have put forward is for medical care financed under social security,Premise
which would be financed under the social security taxes,Premise
which is less than three cents a day per person for medical care doctors bills nurses hospitals when they retire,Premise
he suggests that as far as his medical care program is concerned that that really isnt a problem because its from social security,Claim
social security is a tax,Premise
the people pay it,Premise
it comes right out of your paycheck,Premise
this doesnt mean that the people arent going to be paying the bill,Premise
his agricultural program is concerned that he feels it will cost less than ours,Claim
i dont think we should have that kind of a program,Premise
he goes on to say that hes going to change the interestrate situation,Claim
were going to get some more money that way,Claim
he is saying there in effect were going to have inflation,Claim
were going to go right back to what we had under mr truman when he had political control of the federal reserve board,Premise
i dont believe we ought to pay our bills through inflation through a phony interest rate,Claim
i believe basically that what we have to do is to stimulate that sector of america the private enterprise sector of the economy there is the greatest possibility for expansion,Claim
i advocate a program of tax reform which will stimulate more investment in our economy,Claim
i am never satisfied with the economic growth of this country,Claim
im not satisfied with it even if there were no communism in the world,Claim
when were in the kind of a race were in we have got to see that america grows just as fast as we can provided we grow soundly,Claim
even though we have maintained as i pointed out in our first debate the absolute gap over the soviet union,Premise
even though the growth in this administration has been twice as much as it was in the truman administration,Premise
that isnt good enough,Claim
america must be able to grow enough not only to take care of our needs at home for better education and housing and health  all these things we want,Premise
weve got to grow enough to maintain the forces that we have abroad and to wage the nonmilitary battle for the war  uh  for the world in asia in africa and latin america,Premise
its going to cost more money,Claim
growth will help us to win that battle,Claim
we have to move on other areas that are holding back growth,Claim
for example to distressed areas,Premise
we have to move into those areas with programs so that we make adequate use of the resources of those areas,Claim
we also have to see that all of the people of the united states  the tremendous talents that our people have  are used adequately,Claim
the equality of opportunity for employment and education is not just for the benefit of the minority groups,Claim
ts for the benefit of the nation so that we can get the scientists and the engineers and all the rest that we need,Claim
we need programs particularly in higher education which will stimulate scientific breakthroughs which will bring more growth,Premise
america has not been standing still,Premise
anybody who says americas been standing still for the last seven and a half years hasnt been traveling around america,Premise
we have been moving,Premise
we have been moving much faster than we did in the truman years,Premise
we can and must move faster,Claim
thats why i stand so strongly for programs that will move america forward in the sixties,Premise
hes been traveling in some other country,Premise
the farmer who grows wheat gets about two and a half cents out of a twentyfivecent loaf of bread,Claim
even if you put his income up ten percent that would be two and threequarters percent three pers or three cents out of that twentyfive cents,Premise
the t man who grows tomatoes  it costs less for those tomatoes than it does for the label on the can,Premise
i believe when the average hour for many farmers wage is about fifty cents an hour he should do better,Claim
anybody who suggests that that program would c come to any figure indicated by the vice president is in error,Claim
the vice president suggested a number of things,Premise
he suggested that we aid distressed areas,Premise
the administration has vetoed that bill passed by the congress twice,Premise
he suggested we pass an aid to education bill,Premise
the administration and the republican majority in the congress has opposed any realistic aid to education,Claim
the vice president cast the deciding vote against federal aid for teachers salaries in the senate which prevented that being added,Claim
this administration and this country last year had the lowest rate of economic growth  which means jobs  of any major industrialized society in the world in 1959,Premise
when we have to find twentyfive thousand new jobs a week for the next ten years were going to have to grow more,Claim
governor rockefeller says five per cent,Premise
the democratic platform and others say five per cent,Premise
many say four and a half per cent,Premise
the last eight years the average growth has been about two and a half per cent,Premise
thats why we dont have full employment today,Claim
there are about a hundred and four commodities that have some kind of depletion allowance  different kind of minerals including oil,Premise
i believe all of those should be gone over in detail to make sure that no one is getting a tax break,Claim
to make sure that no one is getting away from paying the taxes he ought to pay,Claim
that includes oil,Claim
it includes all kinds of minerals,Claim
it includes everything within the range of taxation,Claim
we want to be sure its fair and equitable,Premise
it includes oil abroad,Claim
perhaps that oil abroad should be treated differently than the oil here at home,Premise
the oil industry recently has had hard times,Premise
particularly some of the smaller producers,Premise
theyre moving about eight or nine days in texas,Premise
i can assure you that if im elected president the whole spectrum of taxes will be gone through carefully,Claim
if there is any inequities in oil or any other commodity then i would vote to close that loophole,Premise
i have voted in the past to reduce the depletion allowance for the largest producers,Premise
for those from five million dollars down to maintain it at twentyseven and a half per cent,Premise
i believe we should study this and other allowances,Claim
tax expense dividend expenses and all the rest and make a determination of how we can stimulate growth,Claim
how we can provide the revenues needed to move our country forward,Claim
senator kennedys position and mine completely different on this,Claim
i favor the present depletion allowance,Claim
i favor it,Claim
not because i want to make a lot of oil men rich,Premise
i want to make america rich,Premise
this is the stimulation the incentive for companies to go out and explore for oil to develop it,Premise
if we didnt have a depletion allowance of certainly i believe the present amount we would have our oil exploration cut substantially in this country,Claim
it is exactly opposite to the senators,Claim
he would be doing exactly the wrong thing,Premise
he suggests that there are a number of other items in this whole depletion field that could be taken into account,Premise
he also said a moment ago that we would get more money to finance his programs by revising the tax laws including depletion,Premise
the oil depletion allowance is one that provides eighty percent of all of those involved in depletion,Premise
youre not going to get much from revenue insofar as depletion allowances are concerned unless you move in the area that he indicated,Claim
i oppose it,Claim
i oppose it,Claim
i oppose it,Claim
i want us to have more oil exploration and not less,Premise
the first thing we have to do is to continue to keep confidence abroad in the american dollar,Claim
i think we have been right in carrying it,Claim
we must continue to have a balanced budget here at home in every possible circumstance that we can,Claim
the moment that we have loss of confidence in our own fiscal policies at home it results in gold flowing out,Premise
we have to increase our exports as compared with our imports,Claim
we have a very strong program going forward in the department of commerce,Claim
this one must be stepped up,Claim
we have to bear in mind that we must get more help from our allies abroad in this great venture in which all free men are involved of winning the battle for freedom,Premise
america has been carrying a tremendous load in this respect,Premise
i have favored our programs abroad for economic assistance and for military assistance,Premise
now we find that the countries of europe for example that we have aided and japan that weve aided in the far east,Premise
these countries  some our former enemies have now recovered completely,Premise
they have got to bear a greater share of this load of economic assistance abroad,Premise
i am advocating and will develop during the course of the next administration a program in which we enlist more aid from these other countries on a concerted basis in the programs of economic development for africa asia and latin america,Claim
the united states cannot continue to carry the major share of this burden by itself,Claim
we can a big share of it,Premise
weve got to have more help from our friends abroad,Premise
i think will be very helpful in reversing the gold flow which you spoke about,Claim
if were going to continue to maintain our position in the sixties we have to maintain a sound monetary and fiscal policy,Claim
we have to have control over inflation,Claim
the difficulty is that we do have heavy obligations abroad that we have to maintain not only a favorable balance of trade but also send a good deal of our dollars overseas to pay our troops maintain our bases and sustain other economies,Premise
i believe that we must be able to compete in the market,Claim
we must be able to compete against them,Claim
we always did because of our technological lead,Premise
we have to be sure to maintain that,Claim
we have to persuade these other countries not to restrict our goods coming in not to act as if there was a dollar gap,Claim
we also have to have a favorable balance of trade,Claim
we have to be able to compete in the world market,Claim
we have to be able to sell abroad more than we consume from abroad if were going to be able to meet our obligations,Claim
many of the countries around the world still keep restrictions against our goads,Premise
going all the way back to the days when there was a dollar shortage,Premise
there isnt a dollar shortage,Premise
yet many of these countries continue to move against our goods,Premise
i think there are many tests of prestige,Claim
the significance of prestige is because were so identified with the cause of freedom,Premise
if we are on the mount,Premise
if we are rising,Premise
if our influence is spreading,Premise
if our prestige is spreading,Premise
those who stand now on the razor edge of decision between us or between the communist system should use the system of freedom to develop their countries or the system of communism,Claim
theyll be persuaded to follow our example,Claim
there have been several indications that our prestige is not as high as it once was,Claim
he said that many of these countries equate space developments with scientific productivity and scientific advancement,Premise
many of these countries now feel that the soviet union which was once so backward is now on a par with the united states,Claim
the economic growth of the soviet union is greater than ours,Claim
mr dulles has suggested its from two to three times as great as ours,Premise
this has a great effect on the s underdeveloped world which faces problems of low income and high population density and inadequate resources,Claim
a gallup poll taken in february asked people in ten countries which country they thought would be first in 1970 both scientifically and militarily,Premise
a majority in every country except greece felt that it would be the soviet union by l970,Claim
we received the support on the position that we had taken of only two african countries liberia and the other union of south africa,Claim
every other african country either abstained or voted against us,Claim
more countries voted against us in asia on this issue than voted with us,Claim
on the neutralists resolution which we were so much opposed to the same thing happened,Claim
i would say our prestige is not so high,Claim
no longer do we give the image of being on the rise,Premise
no longer do we give an image of vitality,Premise
laos is moving in that direction,Claim
guinea and ghana both now are supporting the soviet foreign policy at the un,Claim
the candidate who was a candidate for the president of brazil took a trip to cuba to call on mr castro during the election in order to get the benefit of the castro supporters within brazil,Claim
statement that hes just made is not going to help our gallup polls abroad,Claim
it isnt going to help our prestige either,Claim
lets look at the other side of the coin,Premise
lets look at the vote on the congo,Premise
the vote was seventy to nothing against the soviet union,Premise
lets look at the situation with regard to economic growth as it really is,Premise
we find that the soviet union is a very primitive economy,Premise
its growth rate is not what counts,Claim
we have confidence in america,Premise
dont run her down in order to build her up,Premise
in this whole matter of prestige in the final analysis its whether you stand for whats right,Premise
i can think of nothing that will be a greater blow to the prestige of the united states among the free nations in asia than for us to take senator kennedys advice to go against what a majority of the members of the senate said in 1955,Claim
we will surrender an area to the communists,Claim
if the united states is going to maintain its strength and its prestige we must not only be strong militarily and economically we must be firm diplomatically,Claim
the way to win is not to retreat and not to surrender,Claim
we have been speaking of whether we should have retreat or defeat,Premise
you figure thats going to satisfy them it doesnt satisfy them,Claim
those of us who stand against surrender of territory in the face of blackmail in the ace of force by the communists are standing for the course that will lead to peace,Claim
the chairman of the senate foreign relations committee wrote to the president he received back on the second of october 1958,Premise
neither you nor any other american need feel the us will be involved in military hostilities merely in the defense of quemoy and matsu,Premise
yesterday you used the words triggerhappy in referring to vice president richard nixons stand on defending the islands of quemoy and matsu,Premise
you said the next president would come face to face with a serious crisis in berlin,Claim
we should st strengthen our conventional forces,Premise
we should attempt in january february and march of next year to increase the airlift capacity of our conventional forces,Premise
i dont think there was any implication in secretary dulles statement that quemoy and matsu should not be defended in the event that they were attacked,Claim
that attack was a preliminary to an attack on formosa,Claim
he was going to vote for mr nixon,Claim
he felt that government seizure might be the best way to stop a strike which could not be settled by collective bargaining,Premise
would enable him to be more effective than we have been in handling these strikes,Claim
to management on the other side,Claim
the program the vice president put forward will cost a billion dollars more than the present program,Claim
which costs about six billion dollars a year the most expensive in history,Premise
senator kennedy has indicated on several occasions in this program tonight that i have been misstating his record and his figures,Claim
all the experts who have studied the program indicate that it is the most fantastic program,Premise
the worst program insofar as its effect on the farmers,Premise
america has ever had foisted upon it in an election year or any other time,Premise
senator kennedy left out a part of the cost of that program  a twentyfive percent rise in food prices that the people would have to pay,Claim
are we going to have that when it isnt going to help the farmers,Premise
move her forward so that we can stay ahead of the soviet union and win the battle for freedom and peace,Premise
if america is going to have the growth that he talks about and that i talk about and that we want,Premise
the thing to do is not to discourage individual enterprise,Premise
not to discourage people to go out and discover more oil and minerals,Premise
to encourage them,Premise
mr nixon said on depletion that his record was the opposite of mine,Premise
i said was that this matter should be thoroughly gone into to make sure that there arent loopholes,Premise
if his record is the opposite of that that means that he doesnt want to go into it,Claim
we have to persuade them to assume some of the responsibilities that up till now weve maintained,Claim
to assist underdeveloped countries in africa latin america and asia make an economic breakthrough on their own,Claim
its whether it is catching up with us and it is not catching up with us,Claim
i dont agree with senator kennedy that cuba is lost and certainly china was lost when this administration came into power in 1953,Claim
i look at cuba today i believe that we are following the right course,Claim
a course which is difficult,Claim
a course which under the circumstance is the only proper one which will see that the cuban people get a chance to realize their aspirations of progress through freedom and that they get that with our cooperation with the other organi of the states in the organization of american states,Claim
no,Claim
cuba is not lost,Claim
i dont think this kind of defeatist talk by senator kennedy helps the situation one bit,Claim
there also isnt any question but that the free people of cuba are going to be supported and that they will attain their freedom,Claim
there isnt any question but that we will defend guantanamo if its attacked,Claim
there isnt any question but that we will defend our rights there,Claim
that position is that the united states has a treaty which prohibits us from interfering in the internal affairs of any other state and prohibits them as well,Claim
now im very surprised that senator kennedy who is on the foreign relations committee would have made such a statement as this kind,Claim
as a matter of fact in his book the strategy for peace he took the right position,Claim
we think thats pretty good progress,Claim
senator kennedy also indicated with regard to cuba that he thought that i had made a mistake when i was in cuba in not calling for free elections in that country,Premise
there were eleven dictators in south america and in central america when we came in in 1953,Premise
today there are only three left including the one in cuba,Premise
in the first place ive never suggested that cuba was lost except for the present,Claim
i hope some day it will rise,Claim
i dont think it will rise if we continue the same policies toward cuba that we did in recent years,Claim
weve beamed not a single voice of america program in spanish to all of latin america in the last eight years except for the three months of the hungarian uh  revolution,Claim
i did not criticize him for not calling for free elections,Claim
in his press conference in havana in 1955 he praised the competence and stability of the bicta bict batista dictatorship  that dictatorship had killed over twenty thousand cubans in seven years,Premise
in my speech last night i indicated that i thought that cuba one day again would be free,Claim
where ive been critical of the administrations policy and where i criticized mr nixon,Claim
what i criticized was the failure of the administration to use its great influence to persuade the cuban government to hold free elections particularly in 1957 and 1958,Claim
we never used our influence when we could have used it most effectively,Claim
we never were on the side of freedom,Claim
instead our aid continued to batista which was ineffective,Claim
today cuba is lost for freedom,Premise
in my judgment that statement has been distorted uh  by mr nixon and others in their debates around the country and in their discussions,Claim
mr morgan i suggested that if the united states felt that it could save the summit conference that it would have been proper for us to have expressed regrets,Premise
they were not in accordance with international law,Claim
the u2 flights were proper from the point of view of protecting our security,Premise
i believe mr nixon himself said on may fifteenth that the flights would continue even though mr herter testified before the senate foreign relations committee that they had been canceled as of may twelfth and i believe it is,Claim
the point that is always left out is the fact that we expressed regrets to castro this winter that we expressed regrets for a flight over southern russia in 1958,Claim
that is the accepted procedure between nations,Claim
we expressed regrets for a flight over eastern germany under this administration,Premise
the soviet union in 1955 expressed regrets to us over the bering sea incident,Premise
the chinese communists expressed regrets to us over a plane incident in 1956,Premise
my judgment is that we should follow the advice of theodore roosevelt be strong maintain a strong position but also speak softly,Claim
i believe that in those cases where international custom calls for the expression of a regret if that would have kept the summit going,Claim
in my judgment it was a proper action,Claim
its not appeasement,Claim
its not soft,Claim
i believe we should be stronger than we now are,Claim
i believe we should have a stronger military force,Claim
i believe we should increase our strength all over the world,Claim
i dont confuse words with strength,Claim
in my judgment if the summit was useful if it would have brought us closer to peace that rather than the lie that we told it would have been far better for us to follow the common diplomatic procedure of expressing regrets and then try to move on,Claim
first of all hes wrong in thinking even suggesting that mr khrushchev might have continued the conference if we had expressed regrets,Claim
he knew these flights were going on long before,Premise
that wasnt the reason that he broke up the conference,Claim
second hes wrong in the analogies that he makes,Claim
whenever we do anything thats wrong,Claim
i dont intend ever to express regrets to mr khrushchev or anybody else if im doing something that has the support of the congress and that is right for the purpose of protecting the security of the united states,Claim
i dont intend to see to it that the united states is ever in a position where while were negotiating with the soviet union that we discontinue our intelligence effort,Claim
i just want to make my position absolutely clear with regard to getting intelligence information,Claim
we cannot afford an intelligence gap,Claim
this seems to me is criticism that again is wrong on his part,Claim
when the president of the united states is doing something thats right something that is for the purpose of defending the security of this country against surprise attack he can never express regrets or apologize to anybody including mr khrushchev,Claim
now in that connection senator kennedy has criticized the president on the ground not only of not expressing regrets,Claim
he allowed this flight to take place while the summit conference  or immediately before the summit conference occurred,Premise
i think we have to make progress first in the field of employment,Claim
my intentions in the field of civil rights have been spelled out in the republican platform,Claim
which is an effective way of getting real progress made in this area,Claim
there we would give statutory authority to the committee on government contracts,Premise
certainly i think all of us agree that when anybody has a government contract certainly the money that is spent under that contract ought to be disbursed equally without regard to the race or creed or color of the individual who is to be employed,Claim
i would hope as well should talk on this issue at every opportunity,Claim
i do it right at this time particularly,Claim
when we have khrushchev in this country we cannot continue to have a situation where he can point the finger at the united states of america and say that we are denying rights to our citizens,Premise
i do it because its the responsibility of leadership,Claim
i do it because we have to solve this problem together,Claim
not because i am preaching to the people of the south because this isnt just a southern problem,Claim
its a northern problem and a western problem,Claim
its a problem for all of us,Claim
under the circumstances what do we do,Claim
we believe that there should be provisions whereby the federal government would give assistance to those districts who do want to integrate their schools,Claim
as far as other areas are concerned i think that we have to look to presidential leadership,Claim
that of course was rejected as was the government contracts provision by the special session of the congress to  in which mr kennedy was quite active,Premise
here we have a situation which causes all of us concern,Claim
the denial of the rights of people to the equality which we think belongs to everybody,Premise
this is wrong and we have to do something about it,Claim
ive heard them explain how they tell their children how they can go into a store and buy a loaf of bread but then cant go into that store and sit at the counter and get a coca cola,Premise
what we do is what the attorneygeneral of the united states did under the direction of the president call in the owners of chain stores and get them to take action,Claim
i can assure you that if im elected president we will do so,Claim
those are the questions to which the president must establish a moral tone and moral leadership,Claim
what will be done to provide equality of education in all sections of the united states,Claim
he has not indicated his support of an attempt to provide fair employment practices around the country so that everyone can get a job regardless of their race or color,Claim
nor has he indicated that he will support title three,Premise
which would give the attorney general additional powers to protect constitutional rights,Claim
mr nixon hasnt discussed the two basic questions,Claim
what is going to be done and what will be his policy on implementing the supreme court decision of 1954,Claim
giving aid to schools technically that are trying to carry out the decision is not the great question,Claim
whats he going to do to provide fair employment,Claim
hes been the head of the committee on government contracts thats carried out two cases both in the district of columbia,Premise
these are the questions in these areas that the north and south east and west are entitled to know,Claim
these are the great questions equality of education in school,Claim
what will be the leadership of the president in these areas to provide equality of opportunity for employment,Claim
equality of opportunity in the field of housing which could be done on all federal supported housing by a stroke of the presidents pen,Claim
i think that the president operates in a number of different areas,Claim
first as a legislative leader,Claim
i believe that the passage of the socalled title three which gives the attorney general the power to protect constitutional rights in those cases where its not possible for the person involved to bring the suit,Claim
secondly as an executive leader,Claim
i do not believe that this administration has implemented those bills which represent the will of the majority of the congress on two occasions with vigor,Claim
there have been only six cases brought by this attorney general under the voting bill passed in 1957 and the voting bill passed in 1960,Premise
the right to vote is basic,Claim
thirdly i dont believe that the government contracts division is operated with vigor,Claim
everyone who does business with the government should have the opportunity to make sure that they do not practice discrimination in their hiring,Claim
fourthly as a moral leader,Claim
thats in all sections of the united states,Premise
there is a very strong moral basis for this concept of equality of opportunity,Claim
we are in a very difficult time,Claim
we need all the talent we can get,Claim
we are a goldfish bowl before the world,Claim
we have to practice what we preach,Claim
we set a very high standard for ourselves,Premise
the communists do not,Claim
they set a low standard of materialism,Premise
i believe the president of the united states should indicate it,Claim
i believe in the case of little rock,Claim
if were not going to be s charged before the world with hypocrisy we have to meet those standards,Claim
we preach in the declaration of independence and in the constitution in the statement of our greatest leaders we preach very high standards,Premise
i would have hoped that the president of the united states would have been possible for him to indicate it clearly that uh  the supreme court decision was going to be carried out,Claim
i would have hoped that it would have been possible to use marshals to do so,Claim
i would hope an incident like that would not happen,Claim
i think if the president is responsible if he consults with those involved if he makes it clear that the supreme court decision is going to be carried out in a way that the supreme court planned  with deliberate speed,Claim
then in my judgment providing hes behind action,Claim
i believe we can make progress,Claim
it wou under the handling of the case it was not,Claim
unless the president speaks then of course the country doesnt speak,Claim
i believe on this great moral issue he should speak out and give his views clearly,Claim
franklin roosevelt said  the presidency of the united states is above all a place of moral leadership,Premise
i believe its essential that the president of the united states not only set the tone but he also must lead he must act as he talks,Claim
what we need is action,Claim
what we need here are not just high hopes,Claim
they did nothing at all,Claim
now in the special session of congress and also in the session that preceded it the democratic congress was asked by the president to give us the funds and give us the power to do a job,Premise
in the special session in which senator kennedy was calling the signals along with senator johnson they turned it down,Premise
he himself voted against giving us the powers despite the fact that the bill had already been considered before that it already had hearings on and the congress already knew what it had before it,Claim
senator kennedy has expressed some hopes in this field hopes which i think all americans would share who want some problem  some progress in this area,Claim
i selected a man who stands with me in this field and who will talk with me and work with me on it,Claim
when he selected his vice presidential running mate he selected a man who had voted against most of these proposals and who opposes them at the present time,Claim
we havent had an adequate staff,Claim
we have not had adequate powers,Claim
yet that very committee of which i am chairman has been handicapped by the fact that we have not had adequate funds,Claim
mr morgan no matter how well were doing in the cold war were not doing as well as we should,Claim
weve got to get help from the congress in order to do this,Claim
it must be economic,Claim
it must be technological,Claim
above all it must be ideological,Claim
im not satisfied with what were doing in the cold war,Claim
i believe we have to step up our activities and launch an offensive for the minds and hearts and souls of men,Claim
it is well that they recognize that they have to stand up for their record as well,Claim
we need for example economic assistance,Claim
we need technical assistance,Claim
we need exchange,Claim
we need programs of diplomatic and other character which will be effective in that area,Claim
what tools do we need to fight us,Claim
in this cold war we have to recognize where it is being fought and then we have to develop programs to deal with it,Claim
its being fought primarily in asia in africa and in latin america,Premise
they also have cut four billion dollars off of mutual security in these last six years,Premise
they also have cut two billion dollars off of defense,Premise
that will always be the case as long as the communists are on the international scene in the aggressive tendencies that they presently are following,Claim
i think its time that we nail a few of these distortions about the united states that have been put out,Claim
i would suggest that after premier khrushchevs performance in the united nations compared with president eisenhowers eloquent speech that at the present time communist prestige in the world is at an alltime low and american prestige is at an alltime high,Claim
now that of course is just one factor but its a significant one,Claim
thats a test of prestige,Claim
look at the votes in the united nations over the past seven and a half years,Premise
there were seventy votes for our position and none for theirs,Premise
now looking to what we ought to do in the future,Claim
every time the united states has been an one side and theyve been on the other side our position has been sustained,Claim
the american people should be told the facts,Claim
the rockefeller brothers report general ridgway general gavin the gaither report various reports of congressional committees all indicate that the relative strength of the united states both militarily politically psychologically and scientifically and industrially  the relative strength of united states compared to that of the soviet union and the chinese communists together  has deteriorated in the last eight years,Premise
we should know it,Claim
governor rockefeller has been far more critical in june of our position in the world than i have been,Claim
we have not maintained our position and our prestige,Claim
of course mr nixon is wholly inaccurate when he says that the congress has not provided more funds in fact than the president recommended for national defense,Claim
nineteen fiftythree we tried to put an appropriation of five billion dollars for our defenses,Premise
tomorrow when the preliminary vote is held you will see a strengthening of that position or very closely to it,Claim
last year there were twentynine,Premise
we all know about the vote held this week and it was generally regarded as a defeat for the united states,Claim
if we build our economy the way we should we can afford to do these things,Claim
we must do it,Claim
i believe we can do it,Claim
i believe its essential that we do it,Claim
in the next ten years the balance of power is going to begin to move in the world from one direction or another,Premise
unless we begin to identify ourselves not only with the anticommunist fight but also with the fight against poverty and hunger,Premise
these people are going to begin to turn to the communists as an example,Claim
i think that we could not afford not to do these things,Claim
this goes to our survival,Claim
here in a country which if it is moving ahead if its developing its economy to the fullest in my judgment well have the resources to meet our military commitments and also our commitments overseas,Claim
which we are not now,Claim
i think the united states can afford to do these things,Claim
if india should lose her battle with thirtyfive per cent of the people of the underdeveloped world within her borders then i believe that the balance of power could move against us,Claim
unless were ready to carry out programs like that in the sixties this battle for economic survival which these people are waging are going to be lost,Claim
i would strengthen the development loan fund,Claim
senator fulbright senator humphrey and i tried to do that,Claim
we tried to provide an appropriation of a billion and a half for five years on a longterm loan basis which this administration opposed,Claim
i believe that in cases of india and africa and latin america that this is where our emphasis should be,Claim
it permits us to make sure that the projects which are invested in are going to produce greater wealth,Claim
this permits them to maintain their selfrespect,Claim
i believe instead of doing that we should concentrate our aid in longterm loans which these people can pay back either in hard money or in local currency,Claim
we paid more military aid more aid into laos per person than in any country in the world,Claim
we ought to know now that laos is moving from neutralism in the direction of the communists,Claim
i believe that its far better for the united states instead of concentrating our aid particularly in the underdeveloped world on surplus military equipment  we poured three hundred million dollars of surplus military equipment into laos,Claim
yes,Claim
we have been wholly indifferent to latin america until the last few months,Claim
the program that was put forward this summer after we broke off the sugar quota with cuba really was done,Claim
we wanted to get through the oas meeting a condemnation of russian infiltration of cuba,Premise
we passed an authorization which was the first time really since the interamerican bank which was founded a year ago was developed that we really have looked at the needs of latin america that we have associated ourselves with those people,Claim
senator kennedy has put a great deal of stress on the necessity for economic assistance,Premise
this is important,Claim
its also tremendously important to bear in mind that when you pour in money without pouring in technical assistance at as well that you have a disastrous situation,Claim
we need to step up exchange,Claim
we must stand for our ideals,Claim
we must not meet the communists purely in the field of gross atheistic materialism,Claim
this we must get across to the world,Claim
this is primarily an ideological battle,Claim
a battle for the minds and the hearts and the souls of men,Premise
the other point that i would make with regard to economic assistance and technical assistance is that the united states must not rest its case here alone,Claim
we cant do it unless we do have adequate funds for for example information which has been cut by the congress adequate funds for technical assistance,Claim
we need to step up technical assistance,Claim
trained people in these newly developing countries can operate the economies,Claim
we also have to have in mind something else with regard to this whole situation in the world and that is that as america moves forward,Claim
we not only must think in terms of fighting communism but we must also think primarily in terms of the interests of these countries,Claim
we must associate ourselves with their aspirations,Claim
we must let them know that the great american ideals that these are ideals that belong not to ourselves alone but they belong to everybody,Claim
to combat unemployment we first must concentrate on the very areas to which you refer  the socalled depressed areas,Claim
i do not expect it to come,Claim
we must use all of these weapons for the purpose of combating recession if it should come,Claim
i favor that rather than massive federal spending programs which will come into effect usually long after youve passed through the recessionary period,Claim
if we do get into a recessionary period we should move on that part of the economy which is represented by the private sector,Claim
i mean stimulate that part of the economy that can create jobs,Claim
this means through tax reform and if necessary tax cuts that will stimulate more jobs,Claim
i believe this economy is sound and that were going to move up,Claim
we must use the full resources of the government in these respects one we must see to it that credit is expanded as we go into any recessionary period,Claim
i do not believe were going into a recession,Claim
thats why i have a program for education,Claim
a program in the case of equal job opportunities and one that would also deal with our older citizens,Premise
if were going to combat unemployment then we have to do a better job in these areas,Claim
we found that the bill got into the legislative difficulties and consequently no action was taken,Claim
at the highest priority we must get a bill for depressed areas through the next congress,Claim
now in the last congress there was a bill one by the president one by senator kennedy and members of his party,Premise
i have made recommendations on that and i have discussed them previously and i will spell them out further in the campaign,Claim
we consider this problem of unemployment we have to realize where it is,Claim
it also exists among minority groups,Claim
in analyzing the figures we will find that our unemployment exists among the older citizens,Claim
it exists also among those who are inadequately trained that is those who do not have an adequate opportunity for education,Claim
mr nixon has stated the record inaccurately in regard to the depressed area bill,Claim
im very familiar with it,Premise
i cannot still understand why this administration and mr nixon oppose putting medical care for the aged under social security to give them some security,Claim
i believe we should step up the use of our surplus foods in these areas until were able to get the people back to work,Claim
five cents a day  thats what the food package averages per person,Claim
i believe we should not carry out a hard money high interest rate policy which helped intensify certainly the recession of 1958,Claim
i think helped bring the slowdown of 1960,Claim
if we move into a recession in sixtyone then i would agree that we have to put more money into the economy,Claim
it can be done by either one of the two methods discussed,Claim
one is by the programs such as aid to education,Premise
the other would be to make a judgment on whats the most effective tax program to stimulate our economy,Premise
let me make it very clear that the bill that mr nixon talked about did not mention wilkesbarre or scranton,Claim
it did not mention west virginia,Claim
our bill was far more effective,Claim
the bill introduced and sponsored by senator douglas was far more effective in trying to stimulate the economy of those areas,Claim
he has mentioned the problem of our older citizens,Premise
we passed an area redevelopment bill far more effective than the bill the administration suggested on two occasions,Claim
the president vetoed it both times,Premise
we passed a bill again this year in the senate and it died in the rules committee of the house of representatives,Premise
i think the choice is clear and it involves the future,Claim
i believe this administration has not met its responsibilities in the last eight years that our power relative to that of the communists is declining that were facing a very hazardous time in the sixties,Claim
unless the united states begin to move here i dont believe that were going to meet our responsibility to our own people or to the cause of freedom,Claim
the question is what were going to do in the future,Claim
ive been critical of this administration,Claim
ive been critical of the president,Claim
i believe that our power and prestige in the last eight years has declined,Claim
now what is the issue is what were going to do in the future,Claim
he feels that were moving ahead,Premise
thats an issue between mr nixon and myself,Claim
were not going into a recession in this country economically,Claim
he feels that our power and prestige is stronger than it ever was relative to that of the communists that were moving ahead,Premise
i disagree,Claim
and i believe the american people have to make the choice on november eighth between the view of whether we have to move ahead faster whether what were doing now is not satisfactory whether we have to build greater strength at home and abroad,Claim
thats the great issue,Claim
thats the debate,Claim
president eisenhower moves from the scene on january twentieth and the next four years are the critical years,Premise
thats the argument between mr nixon and myself and on that issue the american people have to make their judgment,Claim
i think its a important judgment,Claim
i think in many ways this election is more important than any since 1932 or certainly almost any in this century,Claim
we disagree very fundamentally on the position of the united states,Premise
if his view prevails then i think thats going to bring an important result to this country in the sixties,Claim
if our view prevails that we have to do more that we have to make a greater national and international effort that we have lost prestige in latin america the new incumbent running for office called on castro during his campaign,Claim
he thought it was important to get the vote of those who were supporting castro in latin america,Premise
we gave more scholarships to the congo than weve given to all of africa the year before,Claim
in africa the united states has ignored latin africa,Premise
they need trained leadership more than anything,Claim
less than two hundred for all the countries of africa,Premise
weve been having a very clear decision in the last eight years,Claim
mr nixon has been part of that administration,Premise
hes had experience in it,Premise
i think senator kennedy should make up his mind with regard to my responsibility,Claim
in our first debate he indicated that i had not had experience or at least had not participated significantly in the making of the decisions,Premise
i dont stand on it,Claim
it isnt something to stand on but something to build on,Claim
i have participated in the discussions leading to the decisions in this administration,Premise
im proud of the record of this administration,Premise
what does he offer,Claim
now looking at senator kennedys credentials he is suggesting that he will move america faster and further than i will,Premise
he offers retreads of programs that failed,Claim
i say the programs and the leadership that failed then is not the program and the leadership that america needs now,Claim
when we compare the economic progress of this country in the truman administration with that of the eisenhower administration we find that in every index there has been a great deal more performance and more progress in this administration than in that one,Premise
his program for example with regard to the federal reserve and free money or loose money high  low interest rates,Premise
his program in the economic field generally are the programs that were adopted and tried during the truman administration,Premise
i say that the american people dont want to go back to those policies,Claim
incidentally if senator kennedy disagrees he should indicate where he believes those policies are different from those hes advocating today,Claim
no,Claim
it would not be appropriate for me to do so,Claim
i havent talked to prime minister macmillan,Premise
he of course is the only one who could commit this country in this period,Claim
the president is still going to be president for the next four months,Premise
under these circumstances i therefore strongly urge and i will strongly hold,Claim
gave some assurance that he really wanted to sit down and talk and to accomplish something and not just to make propaganda,Claim
we must not build up the hopes of the world and then dash them as was the case in paris,Claim
he was going to break it up,Claim
mr khrushchev came to that conference determined to break it up,Claim
he knew that he wasnt going to get his way on berlin and on the other key matters with which he was concerned at the paris conference,Premise
if were going to have another summit conference there must be negotiations at the diplomatic level prior to that time which will delineate the issues and which will prepare the way for the heads of state to meet and make some progress,Claim
otherwise if we find the heads of state meeting and not making progress we will find that the cause of peace will have been hurt rather than helped,Claim
i have no disagreement with the vice presidents position on that,Claim
before we go into the summit before we ever meet again i think its important that the united states build its strength that it build its military strength as well as its own economic strength,Claim
its going to be a test of our nerve and will,Claim
its going to be a test of our strength,Claim
if we negotiate from a position where the power balance or wave is moving away from us its extremely difficult to reach a successful decision on berlin as well as the other questions,Claim
now the next president of the united states in his first year is going to be confronted with a very serious question on our defense of berlin our commitment to berlin,Premise
i believe that before we meet that crisis that the next president of the united states should send a message to congress asking for a revitalization of our military strength,Claim
come spring or late in the winter were going to be face to face with the most serious berlin crisis since l949 or fifty,Claim
we have not maintained our strength with sufficient vigor in the last years,Premise
were going to move in sixtyone and two partly,Premise
on the question of the summit i agree with the position of mr nixon,Claim
i would not meet mr khrushchev unless there were some agreements at the secondary level which would indicate that the meeting would have some hope of success or a useful exchange of ideas,Claim
i dont think that in the winter of sixtyone under present economic conditions increase would be desirable,Claim
in fact it would be deflationary,Claim
it would cause great unemployment,Claim
it would cause a real slowdown in our economy,Claim
if it ever becomes necessary and is wise economically and essential to our security i would have no hesitancy in suggesting a tax increase or any other policy which would defend the united states,Claim
i have talked in every speech about the fact that these are going to be very difficult times in the nineteensixties,Claim
that were going to have to meet our responsibilities as citizens,Claim
im talking about a national mood,Premise
im talking about our willingness to bear any burdens in order to maintain our own freedom and in order to meet our freedom around the globe,Premise
we dont know what the futures going to bring,Claim
i would not want anyone to elect me president of the united states under the expectation that life would be easier if i were elected,Claim
thats how the united states began to prepare for its great actions in world war ii and in the postwar period,Claim
many of the programs that im talking about build the strength of the united states,Premise
if were moving ahead if were providing a viable economy if our people have sufficient resources so that they can consume what we produce then this countrys on the move then were stronger then we set a better example to the world,Claim
we have the problem of not only building our policies abroad we have to do a job here at home,Claim
i believe that the policies that i recommend came under the general heading of strengthening the united states,Claim
were not able to consume what were able to produce at a time when the soviet union is making great economic gains,Claim
were using our steel capacity fiftyfive per cent today,Premise
i think its going to be difficult,Claim
im confident that this country can meet its responsibilities,Claim
i merely say that if they elect me president i will do my best to carry the united states through a difficult period,Claim
i would not want people to elect me because i promised them the easy soft life,Claim
i dont know what the sixties will bring,Claim
except i think they will bring hard times in the international sphere,Claim
i hope we can move ahead here at home in the united states,Claim
im confident we can do a far better job of mobilizing our economy and resources in the united states,Claim
l i think we should be under no illusions whatever about what the responsibilities of the american people will be in the sixties,Claim
our expenditures for defense our expenditures for mutual security our expenditures for economic assistance and technical assistance are not going to get less,Claim
in my opinion theyre going to be greater,Claim
i think it may be necessary that we have more taxes,Claim
i hope not,Claim
i hope we can economize elsewhere,Claim
we dont have to,Claim
when you do not tax and tax enough to pay for your outgo you pay it many times over in higher prices and inflation,Premise
i simply will not do that,Claim
i would have no hesitation to ask the american people to pay the taxes even in l961 to maintain a sound economy and also to maintain a sound dollar,Premise
i think i should also add that as far as senator kennedys proposals are concerned if he intends to carry out his platform it is just impossible for him to make good on those promises without raising taxes or without having a rise in t prices or both,Claim
it isnt going to be working that way,Claim
the platform suggests that it can be done through economic growth that it can be done in effect with mirrors,Premise
you cant add billions of dollars to our expenditures and not pay for it,Claim
it isnt paid for by my money it isnt paid for by his but by the peoples money,Claim
i did,Claim
i have a responsibility to correct him every time he misstates the case,Claim
i intend to continue to do so,Claim
hes doing a very effective job of that in his way,Claim
we get it absolutely clear senator kennedy must as a candidate criticize us when were wrong,Claim
he has a responsibility to be accurate,Claim
it isnt necessary to run america down in order to build her up,Claim
in pointing out the things that are wrong i think we ought to emphasize americas strengths,Claim
were the best fed were the best clothed with a better distribution of this worlds goods to all of our people than any people in history,Claim
this just wasnt true,Claim
the thing that is right about the united states it should be emphasized is that less people go to bed hungry in the united states than in any major country in the world,Premise
there are people who go to bed hungry in the united states  far less incidentally than used to go to bed hungry when we came into power at the end of the truman administration,Premise
i dont think it was helpful when he suggested that seventeen million people go to bed hungry every night in the united states,Claim
i think this is very harmful at a time mr khrushchev is here,Claim
its wrong,Claim
i dont think he should say that our prestige is at an alltime low,Claim
he has a responsibility to be accurate and not to misstate the case,Claim
i think he has a perfect right and a responsibility to criticize this administration whenever he thinks were wrong,Claim
in this administration weve stopped them at quemoy and matsu weve stopped them in indochina weve stopped them in lebanon weve stopped them in other parts of the world,Claim
in the truman administration six hundred million people went behind the iron curtain including the satellite countries of eastern europe and communist china,Premise
i made it very clear that as far as the korean war was concerned that i felt that the decision to go into the war in korea was right and necessary,Claim
what i criticized were the policies that made it necessary to go to korea,Premise
i believe that on this subject we can balance the budget unless we have a national emergency or unless we have a severe recession,Claim
i believed in a balanced budget,Claim
you cant tell me that a surplus food distribution of five cents per person and that nearly six million americans receiving that  is adequate,Claim
now ive seen a good many hundreds of thousands of people who are not adequately fed,Premise
you cant tell me that any one who uses beans instead of meat in the united states  is well fed or adequately fed,Claim
there are twentyfive million of them according to mr benson,Premise
i believe that we should not compare what our figures may be to india or some other country that has serious problems but to remember that we are the most prosperous country in the world and that these people are not getting adequate food theyre not getting in many cases adequate shelter,Claim
we ought to try to meet the problem,Claim
unless there was a severe recession larger than in any administration in the history of the united states,Premise
the worst unbalanced budget in history was in 1958 twelve billion dollars,Premise
theyre wholly inaccurate,Claim
mr nixon has continued to state these fantastic figures of what the democratic budget platform would cost,Premise
i believe strongly in the defense of formosa,Claim
the united states has on occasion attempted mostly in the middle fifties to persuade chiang kaishek to pull his troops back to formosa,Premise
we say we will defend it if its part of a general attack on formosa,Claim
we have never said flatly that we will defend quemoy and matsu if its attacked,Claim
its extremely difficult to make that judgment,Claim
i believe that if youre going to get into war for the defense of formosa it ought to be on a clearly defined line,Claim
general ridgway has said the same thing,Premise
admirals spruance and callins in 1955 said that we should not attempt to defend these islands in their conference in the far east,Premise
now mr herter in 1958 when he was under secretary of state said they were strategically undefensible,Premise
one of the problems i think at the time of south korea was the question of whether the united states would defend it if it were attacked,Claim
i believe that we should defend formosa,Claim
we should come to its defense,Claim
to leave this rather in the air that we will defend it under some conditions but not under other,Premise
i think is a mistake,Claim
as long as they are not essential to the defense of formosa its been my judgment ever since 1954 at the time of the eisenhower doctrine for the far east that our line should be drawn in the sea around the island itself,Claim
i do not believe that that line in case of war should be drawn on those islands but instead on the island of formosa,Claim
i believe we should meet our commitments to every country whose security weve guaranteed,Claim
i believe strongly we should do so in formosa,Claim
i believe strongly we should do so in berlin,Claim
i think that we should protect our commitments,Claim
with general ridgway mr herter general collins admiral spruance and many others i think its unwise to take the chance of being dragged into a war which may lead to a world war over two islands which are not strategically defensible which are not according to their testimony essential to the defense of formosa,Claim
i believe that we should consult with them and attempt to work out a plan by which the line is drawn at the island of formosa,Claim
it leaves a hundred miles between the sea,Premise
it is a decision finally that the nationalists should make,Claim
i would not suggest the withdrawal at the point of the communist gun,Claim
i disagree completely with senator kennedy on this point,Claim
it didnt mean that,Claim
i suppose it was hoped when he made that speech that we wouldnt get into a war,Premise
secretary acheson made a very famous speech at the press club early in the year that k korean war started indicating in effect that south korea was beyond the defense zone of the united states,Premise
i remember in the period immediately before the korean war south korea was supposed to be indefensible as well,Premise
generals testified to that,Premise
i would never tolerate it as president of the united states,Claim
i will hope that senator kennedy will change his mind if he should be elected,Claim
i am against it,Claim
in my opinion this is the same kind of woolly thinking that led to disaster for america in korea,Claim
if we do that we start a chain reaction,Claim
the communists arent after quemoy and matsu theyre after formosa,Premise
we should not force our nationalist allies to get off of them and give them to the communists,Claim
we had to go in when they came in,Claim
now i think as far as quemoy and matsu are concerned that the question is not these two little pieces of real estate  they are unimportant,Claim
it isnt the few people who live on them  they are not too important,Claim
its the principle involved,Claim
these two islands are in the area of freedom,Premise
the nationalists have these two islands,Premise
thats the way we elect a president in this country,Claim
its the way we should,Claim
its what we believe,Claim
its what we stand for,Claim
its our whole lives,Claim
its what we are,Claim
i believe that in an election when we are trying to determine who should lead the free world,Claim
it isnt the label that he wears or that i wear that counts,Claim
as senator kennedy has already indicated the most important election in our history,Premise
not just america,Premise
i dont think its enough to go before republican audiences and say look vote for me because im a republican,Claim
i never do,Claim
i dont think its enough for senator kennedy to go before the audiences on the democratic side and say vote for me because im a democrat,Claim
that isnt enough,Claim
whats involved here is the question of leadership for the whole free world,Claim
now that means the best leadership,Claim
it may be republican it may be democratic,Premise
the people are the ones that determine it,Claim
the people have to make up their minds,Claim
i believe the people,Claim
should be asked to make up their minds not simply on the basis of vote the way your grandfather did vote the way your mother did,Claim
i think the people should put america first rather than party first,Claim
we do have programs in all of these fields that will move america forward,Claim
this is what i deeply believe,Claim
they will move her forward faster,Premise
they will move her more surely than in his program,Premise
im sure he believes just as deeply that his will move that way,Claim
i suggest however that in the interest of fairness that he could give me the benefit of also believing as he believes,Claim
i do think that parties are important in that they tell something about the program and something about the man,Claim
abraham lincoln was a great president of all the people,Claim
he was selected by his party at a key time in history,Claim
his party stood for something,Premise
the democratic party in this century has stood for something,Claim
it has stood for progress,Claim
it has stood for concern for the peoples welfare,Claim
as a result produced wilson president roosevelt and president truman,Premise
it has stood for a strong foreign policy and a strong national defense,Claim
i think that record tells something,Claim
the republicans in recent years have opposed housing opposed care for the aged opposed federal aid to education opposed minimum wage,Premise
thats the importance of party,Claim
only if it tells something about the record,Premise
they do stand for something,Claim
they stand for a whole different approach to the problems facing this country at home and abroad,Claim

why pass a law that wont fix it,Premise
we become so preoccupied with the rights of the criminal that weve forgotten the rights of the innocent,Claim
in our country we have evolved to a point where weve put millions of innocent people in jail,Claim
you go to the poor neighborhoods and theyve put bars on their windows and bars on their doors and put themselves in jail to protect the things that they acquired legitimately,Premise

i think you have to help doctors stop practicing defensive medicine,Claim
i think you have to have a system of primary and preventive clinics in our inner cities and our rural areas so people can have access to health care,Claim

they cant have an election right now,Premise
theres only 25 percent of the people in there,Premise

i said if we do the things that ive set out and we are successful we could begin to draw the troops down in six months,Premise
i think a critical component of success in iraq is being able to convince the iraqis and the arab world that the united states doesnt have longterm designs on it,Claim
some people say theyve got a rather permanent concept to them,Claim
were building some 14 military bases there now,Premise
when you guard the oil ministry,Premise
you dont guard the nuclear facilities,Premise
the message to a lot of people is maybe wow maybe theyre interested in our oil,Claim
the problem is that they didnt think these things through properly,Claim
these are the things you have to think through,Claim
what i want to do is change the dynamics on the ground,Claim
you have to do that by beginning to not back off of the fallujahs and other places and send the wrong message to the terrorists,Claim
you have to close the borders,Claim
youve got to show youre serious in that regard,Claim
youve also got to show that you are prepared to bring the rest of the world in and share the stakes,Claim
the united states of america has no longterm designs on staying in iraq,Claim
our goal in my administration would be to get all of the troops out of there with a minimal amount you need for training and logistics as we do in some other countries in the world after a war to be able to sustain the peace,Claim
thats how were going to win the peace by rapidly training the iraqis themselves,Claim
even the administration has admitted they havent done the training,Claim
they came back to congress a few weeks ago and asked for a complete reprogramming of the money,Premise
there are 100000 troops trained police guard special units border patrol,Premise
theres going to be 125000 trained by the end of this year,Premise
were getting the job done,Claim
its hard work,Claim
everybody knows its hard work,Claim
theres a determined enemy thats trying to defeat us,Premise
my opponent says hes going to try to change the dynamics on the ground,Claim
you cant change the dynamics on the ground if youve criticized the brave leader of iraq,Claim
prime minister allawi was here he is the leader of that country hes a brave brave man when he came after giving a speech to the congress my opponent questioned his credibility,Premise
one of his campaign people alleged that prime minister allawi was like a puppet,Premise
thats no way to treat somebody whos courageous and brave that is trying to lead his country forward,Claim
the way to make sure that we succeed is to send consistent sound messages to the iraqi people that when we give our word we will keep our word that we stand with you that we believe you want to be free,Claim
i believe that 25 million people the vast majority long to have elections,Claim
i reject this notion,Claim
i reject the notion that some say that if youre muslim you cant free you dont desire freedom,Claim
i disagree strongly disagree with that,Claim
i couldnt agree more that the iraqis want to be free and that they could be free,Claim
i think the president again still hasnt shown how hes going to go about it the right way,Claim
prime minister allawi came here and he said the terrorists are pouring over the border,Premise
thats allawis assessment,Premise
the national intelligence assessment that was given to the president in july said bestcase scenario more of the same of what we see today worstcase scenario civil war,Premise
i can do better,Claim
prime minister allawi said theyre coming across the border,Claim
he recognizes that this is a central part of the war on terror,Premise

its essential we hold the line,Claim
its essential we win,Claim
under my leadership were going to win this war in iraq,Claim
i would hope i never have to,Claim
i understand how hard it is to commit troops,Premise
never wanted to commit troops,Premise
the enemy attacked us,Premise
i have a solemn duty to protect the american people to do everything i can to protect us,Claim
i think that by speaking clearly and doing what we say and not sending mixed messages it is less likely well ever have to use troops,Claim
i was hopeful diplomacy would work in iraq,Claim
there was no doubt in my mind that saddam hussein was hoping that the world would turn a blind eye,Premise
if he had been in power in other words if we would have said let the inspectors work or lets you know hope to talk him out maybe an 18th resolution would work,Premise
he would have been stronger and tougher,Claim
the world would have been a lot worse off,Claim
theres just no doubt in my mind we would rue the day had saddam hussein been in power,Claim
we use diplomacy every chance we get believe me,Claim
i would hope to never have to use force,Claim
by speaking clearly and sending messages that we mean what we say weve affected the world in a positive way,Claim
libya was a threat,Premise
libya is now peacefully dismantling its weapons programs,Premise
libya understood that america and others will enforce doctrine and that the world is better for it,Premise
i would hope we never have to,Claim
i think by acting firmly and decisively it will mean it is less likely we have to use force,Claim
saddam hussein didnt attack us,Claim
osama bin laden attacked us,Claim
al qaida attacked us,Claim
we didnt use the best trained troops in the world to go kill the worlds number one criminal and terrorist,Premise
they outsourced the job to afghan warlords who only a week earlier had been on the other side fighting against us neither of whom trusted each other,Premise
thats the enemy that attacked us,Claim
he also said saddam hussein would have been stronger,Claim
that is just factually incorrect,Claim
thats the enemy that was allowed to walk out of those mountains,Premise
thats the enemy that is now in 60 countries with stronger recruits,Premise
twothirds of the country was a nofly zone when we started this war,Premise
we would have had sanctions,Claim
we would have had the un inspectors,Claim
saddam hussein would have been continually weakening,Claim
if the president had shown the patience to go through another round of resolution to sit down with those leaders say what do you need what do you need now how much more will it take to get you to join us wed be in a stronger place today,Claim
to think that another round of resolutions would have caused saddam hussein to disarm disclose is ludicrous in my judgment it just shows a significant difference of opinion,Claim
we tried diplomacy,Premise
we did our best,Claim
he was hoping to turn a blind eye,Premise
he would have been stronger had we not dealt with him,Claim
he had the capability of making weapons,Claim
he would have made weapons,Claim
thirtyfive to forty countries in the world had a greater capability of making weapons at the moment the president invaded than saddam hussein,Claim
while hes been diverted with 9 out of 10 active duty divisions of our army either going to iraq coming back from iraq or getting ready to go north koreas gotten nuclear weapons and the world is more dangerous,Claim

ive been fighting for proliferation the entire time  antiproliferation the entire time ive been in the congress,Premise
weve watched this president actually turn away from some of the treaties that were on the table,Premise
you dont help yourself with other nations when you turn away from the global warming treaty for instance or when you refuse to deal at length with the united nations,Premise

i understand that in certain capitals around the world that that wasnt a popular move,Claim
its the right move not to join a foreign court that could  where our people could be prosecuted,Claim

i just think trying to be popular kind of in the global sense,Claim
if its not in our best interest makes no sense,Claim
im interested in working with our nations and do a lot of it,Claim
im not going to make decisions that i think are wrong for america,Claim
north korea first i do,Claim

in crawford texas jiang zemin and i agreed that the nuclearweaponsfree peninsula korean peninsula was in his interest and our interest and the worlds interest,Premise

we included south korea japan and russia,Premise
now there are five voices speaking to kim jong il not just one,Premise
if kim jong il decides again to not honor an agreement hes not only doing injustice to america,Claim

i think this will work,Claim
its not going to work if we open up a dialogue with kim jong il,Claim
thatâ€™s what he wants,Claim
he wants to unravel the six party talks or the fivenation coalition thats sending him a clear message,Claim
on iran i hope we can do the same thing continue to work with the world to convince the iranian mullahs to abandon their nuclear ambitions,Claim
weve got a good strategy,Claim
theres a special protocol recently been passed that allows for inspections,Premise
the iaea is involved,Premise
i believe we could have done better,Claim
i think the united states should have offered the opportunity to provide the nuclear fuel test them see whether or not they were actually looking for it for peaceful purposes,Claim
if they werent willing to work a deal then we could have put sanctions together,Claim
the president did nothing,Claim
with respect to north korea the real story we had inspectors and television cameras in the nuclear reactor in north korea,Premise
secretary bill perry negotiated that under president clinton,Premise
we knew where the fuel rods were,Premise
we knew the limits on their nuclear power,Premise
the president reversed it publicly while the president of south korea was here,Premise
the president of south korea went back to south korea bewildered and embarrassed,Claim

the breach on the agreement is highly enriched uranium,Premise

in order for the sanctions to be effective we should have been working with the british french and germans and other countries,Claim
thats the difference between the president and me,Claim
with respect to darfur yes it is a genocide,Claim
i think the reason that were not saying send american troops in at this point is severalfold,Claim
we can do this through the african union providing we give them the logistical support,Claim
right now all the president is providing is humanitarian support,Claim
we need to do more than that,Claim
theyve got to have the logistical capacity to go in and stop the killing,Claim
i also believe that it is  one of the reasons we cant do it is were overextended,Claim
weve got guards and reserves who are doing double duties,Premise
weve got a backdoor draft taking place in america today,Claim
people with stoploss programs where theyre told you cant get out of the military,Premise
nine out of our 10 active duty divisions committed to iraq one way or the other either going coming or preparing,Premise

i also intend to double the number of special forces,Claim
we can do the job we need to do with respect fighting the terrorists around the world,Claim

the strategic beliefs that are necessary to protect this country in the world,Premise
i worry about with the president is that hes not acknowledging whats on the ground,Claim

saddam hussein is a threat,Claim

i did a lot of work on this,Claim
i wrote a book about it several years ago  six seven years ago  called the new war which saw the difficulties of this international criminal network,Premise
this president i regret to say has secured less nuclear material in the last two years since 911 than we did in the two years preceding 911,Claim
the president actually cut the money for it,Claim
you have to put the money into it and the funding and the leadership,Claim
part of that leadership is sending the right message to places like north korea,Claim
right now the president is spending hundreds of millions of dollars to research bunkerbusting nuclear weapons,Claim
the united states is pursuing a new set of nuclear weapons,Claim

that is another way to help deal with the threats that we face in the 21st century,Claim
my opponent opposed the missile defenses,Claim
im going to do it in four years,Claim
im going to immediately set out to have bilateral talks with north korea,Claim
i cant tell you how big a mistake i think that is to have bilateral talks with north korea,Claim
its precisely what kim jong il wants,Claim
it will cause the sixparty talks to evaporate,Claim
it will mean that china no longer is involved in convincing along with us for kim jong il to get rid of his weapons,Claim
its a big mistake to do that,Claim
we must have chinas leverage on kim jong il besides ourselves,Claim
if you enter bilateral talks theyll be happy to walk away from the table,Claim
i dont think thatll work,Claim
i dont think its ok,Claim
i think that there needs to be checks and balances in a democracy,Claim
